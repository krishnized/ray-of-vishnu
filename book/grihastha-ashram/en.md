# **Gṛhastha Āśrama. Family Life as a Spiritual Path**

_by Chaitanya Chandra Charan Dāsa_

This book is dedicated
to my spiritual master,
**Śrīla Jayapatākā Swami Mahārāja**,
who always wished that devotees
fully dedicated to spiritual life
and living in family life
would be truly happy.


## **Preface**

Why did the idea come to me to write a book about gṛhastha-āśrama? First of all, because it was the desire of my spiritual master.

For a long time I avoided this very important subject, thinking that it was more important to preach renunciation. But in time I saw that preaching renunciation can easily turn into a kind of show or fashion. Therefore, it is far more important to give people not merely the idea of renunciation, but the **path** to it.

Renunciation is not simply a social status; it is an ever-growing attachment to Kṛṣṇa. And this is a science that must have its place in every family.

Very often people come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness already carrying emotional wounds and the painful experience of broken or confused family relationships, which instills in them fear of gṛhastha-āśrama. Seeing the failures of others, some are afraid to start a family, others feel embarrassed, and still others simply do not care. Therefore I am convinced that we need a science that will spiritualize family life and, in the future, create great families. Hoping to bring at least a small benefit to sincere souls, I am trying to share my reflections, convictions, and realizations on this difficult subject.

Is it possible, in our troubled times, to build family life on spiritual foundations?

Yes—precisely because our times are troubled, since almost no one in the world builds family life on a spiritual basis. For us, devotees, it is even more difficult: society does not support our way of life, and we ourselves still carry bad habits and character traits instilled by the culture in which we were raised. It takes time and patience until the fire of Kṛṣṇa consciousness “digests” our sins and cleanses the heart.

Since we have chosen this path, let us hold to it to the very end.

## **Introduction**

> “Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, the greatest of all transcendentalists, and I beg You to explain to me the nature of the relationship between man and woman, and between spirit and matter.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.25.11*

It is very difficult to understand the laws of human society without studying the relationship between man and woman within the family, because the hidden cause of the material manifestation rests upon the desires of the masculine and feminine principles. Family life unites matter and spirit, and when they meet, they form a field of activity that gives rise to contradictions and conflicts, love and hatred, spiritual searching and degradation. Within it are contained all the tastes of life and all varieties of suffering. Man and woman, coming together, seek ever new shades of happiness in the accumulation of property, in children, in friends, in social activity, in art, and in many other things.

The Vedic scriptures describe family life in two ways, because the family is an inexhaustible source of human potential, an unrevealed mystery, a treasure under seven locks, a sacred union — but it can also become a path to hell and deep suffering.

Śrīla Prabhupāda explains that there are two kinds of householders:

> “In revealed scriptures, householders are called either gṛhasthas or gṛhamedhīs. The gṛhastha is one who lives with wife and children in a transcendental way, aiming to realize the Absolute Truth. The gṛhamedhī, however, lives only for the benefit of his family, in the narrow or extended sense of the term, and therefore he is envious of others.”

Thus, men and women, forming families of which any society is composed, can create two types of civilization.

The first type of civilization is based on selfless, loving service to God and on preserving religious and family traditions in accordance with the injunctions given by God Himself. This is the path of developing the unrealized potential of humanity.

The second type of civilization, based on possessiveness, selfish benefit, and service to oneself and one’s family, has already led to the fact that modern marriage and family traditions are on the verge of extinction.

Intimate relations between a man and a woman outside of marriage are destructive for any civilization — both spiritual and material. But in this book we do not wish to discuss such relationships between two opposite sexes who merely react passionately to one another’s form, smell, and color. This book is about a holy and pure life, about the revival of the beauty and dignity of man and woman, which are revealed in the striving for spirituality and self-realization.

Some spiritually minded people claim that family life and the attachments connected with it are the main obstacle on the path of self-realization. Others say that a person must pass through family life in order to acquire real wisdom. Those who strive for the highest goal of life but do not possess full knowledge usually reason in this way:

> “What should I do? Perhaps it is better to renounce all karmic activity from the very beginning, which means not starting a family. It is quite clear that a life of renunciation facilitates the soul’s progress. On the other hand, I am not sure that I can endure the renounced way of life, which seems extremely harsh because of the high level of self-discipline, and also unreliable because of the risk of falling down. I am not free from a sense of proprietorship and the material desires connected with it, which means I will have to earn my livelihood. But I also understand that material activity and family life entangle a person in constant material needs and desires, and therefore one can easily fall into the clutches of māyā and become a victim of sense gratification. So what should I do? Endure a life of renunciation, or act according to material desires and nature, risking my spiritual life?”

For many neophytes who reflect on renunciation, this situation seems hopeless. They become anxious, their mind loses balance and falls into extremes: “Perhaps spiritual life is not for me at all?”

In such a state of consciousness it is very difficult to remain a yogī. Therefore guru, sādhu, and śāstra must resolve the contradictions created by doubt. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* this question is discussed as one of the most difficult, where Lord Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna:

> tyājyaṁ doṣa-vad ity eke
> karma prāhur manīṣiṇaḥ
> yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma
> na tyājyaṁ iti cāpare
> “Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given up as evil, yet other sages maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity, and penance should never be abandoned.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 18.3*

Sacrifice, charity, and tapasya are different forms of renunciation, although they are active material activities. A man and a woman who are not bound by responsibility and duty toward God will not be able to understand this statement. As long as they are blinded by the desire for sense enjoyment, they do not think about renunciation and do not even suspect that such a path exists. But for those who have dedicated their lives to God, these words are saving: a man and a woman can walk the path of renunciation together, without giving up the activities connected with family life. Any activity performed as a sacrifice to the Lord is flawless. Even great souls who have reached the highest stages of self-realization do not neglect such activity.

> yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma
> na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat
> yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva
> pāvanāni manīṣiṇām
> “Acts of sacrifice, charity, and penance should not be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity, and penance purify even the great souls.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 18.5*

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments on this verse:

> “...There are many purifying processes that bring one closer to spiritual life. For example, the marriage ceremony is considered one of such sacrifices. This ceremony is called vivāha-yajña. Should a sannyāsī, who lives in renunciation and has given up family relations, encourage marriage? In this verse the Lord says that sacrifices which benefit human society should never be given up. The purpose of the marriage ceremony, vivāha-yajña, is to bring the mind into balance and give a person the opportunity for spiritual development. Even those who live in renunciation should encourage most people to perform vivāha-yajña...”

In other words, family life and material activity are presented here as yajña — sacrifice — which should never be abandoned, because it is auspicious even for great souls. It purifies, and therefore makes a person happy. But the same family life and material activity, performed for one’s own benefit and pleasure without sacrifice, is called *karma-bandhana*, bondage to activity. It is ignorant and is the source of all kinds of suffering. Therefore, for all people there is only one righteous path leading to happiness — the path of renunciation.

In conclusion to this subject, Lord Kṛṣṇa explains in what consciousness such yajña should be performed:

> etāny api tu karmāṇi
> saṅgaṁ tyaktvā phalāni ca
> kartavyānīti me pārtha
> niścitaṁ matam uttamam
> “All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be done as a matter of duty, O son of Pṛthā. That is My final judgment.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 18.6*

These words suggest that simply acquiring a husband or wife does not mean attaining complete happiness. A person must accept family life as a means of purification, developing a sense of duty and freeing oneself from false ego, which gives rise to stereotypes. For many years the spouses will live face to face with each other’s thoughts, words, and actions. This means that their ideas about themselves will change, for better and for worse, at the same time. And only when they learn to value the eternal and properly relate to the temporary will they see the truth that binds their souls, while their bodies remain under the power of time.

The path to happiness begins with the desire for the good and love of one’s close ones, despite their shortcomings and imperfections. But only by understanding that family well-being can be achieved only in a good, cultured, and morally sound society does a person accept responsibility not only for the family, but for society as a whole.

The next step should be aimed at eliminating conflicts between states. However, in order to establish peace, common laws of existence or universal commandments are needed. Realizing that the world is one, just as God is one, and acting in such a way that one’s deeds please the Supreme, a person gradually acquires love for God and for all His energies. This is the highest purpose of human life.

Such dependence on the Complete Whole makes the relationship between man and woman in the family happy. Therefore, at the head of the family should stand a God-conscious person, and at the head of the state — such a president. And the laws by which human society lives should be beneficial to every family, and every family, in turn, beneficial to society.

The presence of God in our life is determined by four signs:

1. the sacred scriptures, or śāstras, which are the foundation of existence;
2. the essence of life in such a society is the transmission of divine knowledge from person to person and from generation to generation;
3. thus, by the purity of human thoughts and actions, people acquire strength and power;
4. and finally, this knowledge must be practical — applicable in daily life — and this determines the principles of relationships.

Until people accept these foundations of existence, they will be pursued by endless and varied sufferings. But in the modern world, families do not have authoritative scriptures that give true knowledge, and the knowledge of modern scientists is too meager to provide real help that frees one from suffering. The very concept of transmitting true spiritual knowledge has been lost, and ordinary knowledge is obtained only for money.

Moreover, people do not know how to apply spiritual science in everyday life, and, moreover, they scarcely distinguish the elevated from the impure. Thus, being in illusion, a person performs many meaningless actions, and sometimes even actions harmful to himself and to society. This situation can be changed by powerful families endowed with higher knowledge. Into such families even Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa themselves, the rulers and benefactors of the universe, may descend.

There are people who in this life want to return to God. Their goal is simple and exalted. They already know how to love, and therefore in such families everything works out successfully.

There are people who do not want to return to God, but turn to Him as their protection in life. Between them and God honest “business relations” are established. In such families moral, just, and God-fearing relationships prevail.

There are people who do not want to live with God, but want to depend on their own piety and success. Such people have to make great efforts to earn a reputation and position in society, and also to maintain moral principles in the family.

But those who do not want to live righteously will have to rely only on fleeting luck. Such people, for the sake of profit, deceive even their own relatives. Hiding their sins, they like to speak on elevated topics in order to impress foolish people.

And there are people who do not even hide their sins, because sin has become not only their habit, but the very essence of their nature. They do not know what family is, because they are unable to realize even their own material nature as man or woman, not to speak of duties toward society and God. As a result, they understand that in life there is neither love nor hope, and they seek oblivion in drugs. What kind of family can there be?

But only bhakti can pull even such people out of darkness and elevate them. Gradually a person begins to see the cause of his sufferings, the root of which lies in ignorance and in the lack of knowledge of himself and of God. Gradually the development of spiritual knowledge awakens the desire to return to God and to associate with Him.

One should not try to create a family if there is no knowledge of real happiness. True knowledge is knowledge confirmed by the experience of others. Spiritual life is a science in which there is no place for envy. And to hope for fleeting luck in family life is foolish and hopeless. Family is not a gambling game where one may get lucky or not. Family is not an accidental combination of circumstances with an unknown future. Family is specific people, specific activity, their efforts, and precisely defined goals and tasks. Therefore the result also comes specific and mathematically exact. Everyone receives what he deserves.

The world created by God is in complete balance and peace. Even the turbulent, active ocean is called “Pacific” because it never leaves its shores. Therefore, in order that family life does not turn into a real catastrophe, one must learn to understand and apply the natural laws of balance, and to realize the causes and motives of one’s activity.

Many young girls, like the fairy-tale Assol, are full of inspiration and trembling hopes. They wait for a ship with scarlet sails on which a handsome, strong, and kind young man will come for them. But unfortunately, they do not know that their prince may not be at all as they imagine. He may have a completely different character and karma. They do not know what duty they have toward this person from a past life; perhaps they will simply have to wash clothes and cook for him until the end of their days. They do not know what children they will have, or whether they will have any at all, or how their life will turn out. Perhaps if they knew all this, their romantic love would suffer from prosaic cynicism and from the discrepancy between inspiring desires and real life. People become cynical because of disappointments, when inspiration goes away and one no longer wants to do anything for the other. But one has to — relatives demand it. Such is the prose of life.

Unlike invented, illusory knowledge that brings only disappointment, the śāstras give an exact description of material nature, free from fantasy. Māyā deceives, promising to fulfill all our desires.

But true love is beyond matter, and only there are all desires truly fulfilled. Love is a gift from above. A man and a woman must know that their love is only a reflection of the higher reality, the higher, absolute beauty, which they must seek together throughout their lives. This search will enrich and renew the relationship of the spouses, freeing them from routine and tastelessness, and, what is most important, this search will help them find and reveal themselves.

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is said that inspiration, just like knowledge, can have different qualities.

In ignorance, a person is inspired only by short-term success. But how unreliable and dangerous this is for a family! For example, one may steal someone else’s money without thinking of the consequences. But sooner or later not only he, but his whole unhappy family will suffer.

In passion, one is inspired by an organized system of regular satisfaction of one’s immediate needs, which he calls happiness. In this pursuit he is so busy that the family becomes for him only a place of rest. He has no time for the spiritual development of his relatives, and his relationships with them become banally ordinary. Only new material acquisitions bring joy. And in the end, the whole family looks at their breadwinner in the same way he himself relates to God: he is for them simply a fulfiller of desires and a milk cow — and God forbid he go bankrupt or become greedy!

In goodness, however, a person experiences deep satisfaction in realizing the Personality of God and admiring His qualities. The world opens its horizons before him. He is inspired by altruistic ideas and sacrifice. Family life becomes an interesting school in which there is no time to be bored. Enthusiasm increases, creative potential grows, and even mystical abilities may appear.

In this connection it is important to note that the knowledge and inspiration of the spouses should belong to the same mode of nature. Only in this case are cooperation and understanding possible. One must always remember that the modes are unstable in their position. They constantly rotate, as if flowing from one into another. Therefore, in order not to deviate from the right path, the family must take interest in God, whatever mode it may be in.


# **Part One**

## **Living with God**

> — “Madam, take some books about God.
> This is the *Bhagavad-gītā*.”
> — “I don’t know about living with God, but living without God is hard.
> All right, I’ll take it.”

Living with God is not difficult. In His kingdom there are no problems. It is difficult to live with oneself. The family is a field of activity where the struggle for domination and enjoyment takes place. “I am the man, the head of the family!” — “And I am the woman, the neck: wherever I want, I’ll turn you!” Everyone wants to control the other.

When we speak of “living with God,” it means that we must give Him a portion of our heart that is free from envy and greed. Then love appears — love that expresses itself in the form of service, without the desire to dominate, enjoy, or exploit one another.

Life is good when there is happiness in the heart. Happiness is a great rarity. For most of us this feeling seems unattainable. Yet everyone can feel its nearness. For this, Faith, Hope, and Love are needed — they are the representatives of Happiness in this world. And where these attributes of happiness are present, Beauty is always present as well.

Beauty is the principal attribute of the captivating form of Kṛṣṇa. It is very important in family life to value beauty. It inspires us to live and to believe. Māyā only reflects Kṛṣṇa’s beauty, and all the amazing and glorious creations of this world have arisen from but a spark of His splendor.

Even brāhmaṇas who have studied the Vedas cannot free themselves from doubt. Therefore, experience and much time are needed in order to become convinced of the truth of the śāstras. Gṛhastha-āśrama is the path to liberation from doubt, the path of strengthening one’s faith, because it is very difficult to accept the path to God without relying on one’s personal life. In any case, a person must live and associate with someone, and everyone must have some kind of family.

People who seek spirituality usually accept family life for two reasons.

The first reason arises from failures in spiritual life. A devotee begins to doubt the scriptures, and as a result he develops a desire to keep some distance from God, considering family life to be a suitable refuge for that.

The second reason is the desire to follow the path indicated by the śāstras — what may be called yoga.

If we choose the first version of family life without faith in the statements of the scriptures, this path will inevitably lead us to an increasing desire for sense enjoyment, in whose presence spiritual life will seem inappropriate and even artificially imposed from outside. We will begin to build our future life on material foundations. Of course, one can turn for help to demigods or to a national religion. One can obtain higher education, achieve a high position in society, or accumulate a good amount of wealth. But as a result of material achievements, a person completely loses transcendental knowledge.

But when we accept the second version of family life, such a family gradually forms a foundation upon which it can build a temple in its heart. Yet to build such a foundation requires great effort and knowledge.

A foundation that is too rigid is not suitable for gṛhastha-āśrama; sooner or later it will crack. Ascetic-minded people may think that children are ignorance and impurity, and that affectionate words or simple expressions of tenderness are sentimentality. Such people avoid admiring the beauty of nature, dressing nicely, and are afraid to be happy and to rejoice in life. A family needs a flexible approach. Harsh methods of upbringing and uncompromising sādhana produce ascetics, but they do not fill the heart with love.

At the same time, building on a foundation that is too soft is also difficult. Such family life more resembles a swamp. A person thinks only about the welfare and satisfaction of his family: “My wife, my children, my grandchildren — this is the meaning of my life, and I must serve them as long as I have strength.” He forgets his eternal nature, that he is a servant of Kṛṣṇa.

In a family, firm laws of honor and dignity must be combined with all-forgiving gentleness and patience. We are all children of one family: the Earth is our mother, and Kṛṣṇa is the supreme Father. And we learn family life from Them. The Earth tolerates everyone who lives on it, from the righteous man to the worst scoundrel, yet always remains unwavering in the performance of her duty.


## **The Path to Creating One’s Own Family, or the Path to Gṛhastha-Āśrama**

> “The fact that we see so few successful marriages is precisely what testifies to the value and importance of marriage.”
> — Michel de Montaigne

In truth, the path to gṛhastha-āśrama begins with the family in which a person was born and raised. It does not matter whether this was a Vaiṣṇava family or not. What matters is that we have lived to the present day without losing our sanity — and this gives us the opportunity to reflect on the meaning of life. We should be grateful to our family for preserving this aspiration within us, or at least for not preventing us in our search.

So, the fledgling has grown its feathers and flown from the nest. But when the time comes for it to build its own nest, it will do so in the image and likeness of the parental home. From the very moment of birth, a child absorbs the atmosphere in which he grows up and later transfers this impression to his own family and to society as a whole. The most valuable thing a family can give is parental love — without receiving it, it is impossible to give it to others, and without experiencing it, it is impossible to begin the path to God.

Sometimes we think that a person is formed by the street or by his environment, but the deepest and most decisive influence remains that of his parents and their relationship with him. Recalling their mother and father, young brahmacārīs sometimes lament that the best their relatives could do was criticize others for their faults, while they themselves could not even serve as an example of success. Therefore, one often comes to brahmacārī-āśrama not so much for education as for re-education.

It is another matter when parents are sincere devotees. Their experience always fills us with joy and confidence that we are all together on the right path. A parent is one from whom love, knowledge, and care flow. This is indeed the true path to God.

But since the modern family gives little or almost nothing spiritually to its children, brahmacārī-āśramas are absolutely necessary — places where boys, the future heads of families, can acquire a high level of human culture, receive the spiritual education they lack, and taste the genuine flavor of transcendental bliss.

Activities forbidden by the śāstras are extremely attractive in the age of Kali. Unrestricted sexual relations, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, as well as meat-eating and gambling, are gradually rising to the level of mass culture, which gives a person “full freedom” to enjoy a sinful life — and this quickly leads to the destruction of the family and family traditions.

True culture, however, is expressed in three ways:

1. when a person sees his mother in all women except his own wife,
2. when he regards another’s property as garbage,
3. when he treats everyone as he would like to be treated himself.

For a materialist, these principles are completely tasteless. Yet this is precisely where human culture begins. Therefore, it is precisely in brahmacārī-āśrama that real education begins.

## **The School of Forming the Best Qualities of Character: Brahmacārī-Āśrama**

> “The brahmacārī-āśrama lays the foundation of knowledge in a prospective candidate. In this āśrama one learns that the material world is not actually the home of the living being. Conditioned souls, bound in material bondage, are prisoners of matter, and therefore self-realization is the highest goal of life. The entire system of āśrama-dharma is meant to develop renunciation in a person. One who has not succeeded in developing full renunciation may enter family life and live it in the same spirit of renunciation. And one who has developed renunciation may immediately accept the fourth order of life (renunciation of the world), live only by begging, without accumulating money, being satisfied with the bare necessities of life, and thus attain the highest stage of self-realization. Family life is meant for those who are attached to material life, and vānaprastha and sannyāsa are meant for those who are not attached to it. The brahmacārī-āśrama is meant to train both those who are attached and those who are not attached to material life.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam*, commentary by Śrīla Prabhupāda

All of us are temporarily visiting this world. And here there is a proper etiquette for receiving guests. A guest is usually received with the best feelings, everything is done for his satisfaction, and he is served as a representative of God. And in return, he too must render selfless service. This is brahmacārī-āśrama.

Then, if the guest wishes to stay longer, he becomes a resident and should no longer accept service, but should try to maintain himself, help the hosts in their affairs, and always preserve peace in the home where he is staying. This is gṛhastha-āśrama.

Then, when the time comes for him to leave his temporary shelter, the hosts should no longer engage him in work, but give him time to prepare. This is vānaprastha-āśrama.

And finally, the time comes for the guest to thank the hospitable hosts for their reception, make sure that he leaves behind no dirt or cause for disturbance, and depart. This is sannyāsa-āśrama.

During the period of training, the unmarried brahmacārī lives in the guru’s āśrama, following the way of life of the spiritual master, who takes care of the student, teaches him, and educates him. In return, the student should selflessly do whatever the guru asks. As a result of such selfless service, the senses and mind of the brahmacārī become peaceful, and he easily understands the laws of morality. Having no property and living like a monk, the obedient brahmacārī learns to use the energies of humility, compassion, respect, tolerance, and so on.

In modern schools, students do not receive a full understanding of such principles, because education takes place not in an atmosphere of renunciation, but in an atmosphere of envy and competition between friends and enemies. The strongest wins.

For good upbringing, a child should be placed in equal conditions with others. And when he has been trained in humility and compassion, only then can he be trained in a profession, and in the end he will be able to occupy any position in society.

If a brahmacārī has sufficient determination, then after completing his education he may immediately accept the renounced order of life — sannyāsa — and thus shorten his stay in the sphere of material duties.

But if he doubts and thinks, “When I accept sannyāsa, who will take care of me? How will my relatives remain without my support? Where will I live?”, then in such a case he should not accept sannyāsa. Such a brahmacārī needs to pass through gṛhastha-āśrama.

The varṇas include classes of people who possess intelligence, wealth, and power. And the higher a person’s position, the greater the glory. Such is the inspiring force of varṇa. In contrast to this, the āśramas teach detachment from glory, prestige, and high position. Brahmacārī-āśrama, gṛhastha-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama, and sannyāsa-āśrama are not prestige and fame, but degrees of renunciation of them.

Brahmacārī-āśrama is very useful and beneficial for every man, but at a certain point it can become an obstacle on the path of self-realization. When material desires awaken and a young man cannot engage them in Kṛṣṇa’s service, then these desires will tell him: “Service to God is not for all people, but only for the chosen ones. The rest are of no interest to Kṛṣṇa. I am not chosen, and therefore I have lost my enthusiasm to remain in brahmacārī-āśrama. I want to have my own home and good friends who will understand me.”

Such thinking gives rise to criticism of renunciation and pure selfless service. And this is a great obstacle on the spiritual path. Therefore a person should renounce the life of a brahmacārī and leave this āśrama with a feeling of gratitude and a strong desire to continue serving his spiritual master. For this reason he should take his place in gṛhastha-āśrama, which imposes upon him a greater burden and greater responsibility.


## **The Transitional Period: From Brahmacārī to Gṛhastha**

> “Living in the brahmacārī-āśrama, after four years I realized that my former enthusiasm had disappeared, and that I was acting out of habit, without much interest in my own progress. Then I thought that by obtaining a profession and occupying a high position in society, I would be able to bring more benefit. And now I work in a ministry and preach the teachings of the *Bhagavad-gītā* there.”
> *(From a conversation)*

> “A person who rejects what comes to him of its own accord, and then begs alms from a miser, loses his former glory, and people begin to despise him, wounding his pride with their contempt.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.22.13*

I do not think that in Vedic culture the transition from one āśrama to another was a psychological problem. Rather, it was an inspiring event. But in our time, a brahmacārī who wishes to marry is often confused by contradictory statements of śāstra and sādhus about women and family life. Therefore he begins to think: “Woman is māyā. Just look at her! Woman is the embodiment of deceit. Terrible—and the worst part is that you never know where she will deceive you! A man is like butter, and a woman like fire. O God, what will I become?”

He does not understand that this refers to the nature of women who have not accepted responsibility to be a wife, mother, and sister—positions which, on the contrary, are glorified in the śāstras. In other words, he did not see women as mothers or sisters before, and now he does not see a wife either. Therefore, in order to properly accept gṛhastha-āśrama, one must change one’s vision through careful study of the scriptures.

> “The teacher is ten times more venerable than the instructor, the father a hundred times more venerable than the teacher, but the mother is a thousand times more venerable than the father.”
> — *The Laws of Manu*

> “The three perfections on the path of liberation are religious life, economic development, and sense gratification. It is said that a conditioned soul is delivered by his wife, because she serves her husband and thus helps him ultimately to attain liberation.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.14.17*, Purport of Śrīla Prabhupāda

For example, when we see a woman next to a man, we should understand what binds them. If there is no dharma between them, no higher duty, then it is simply a man and a woman, or the association of male and female bodies. Animals also associate in this way. But if she is a wife, then we look at their relationship differently, because of the responsibility of her position. A wife is a helper in attaining spiritual perfection. In other words, association with one’s wife is not an obstacle to spiritual life.

Thus, if a brahmacārī thinks about a **WIFE**, that is good; but if he thinks simply about a **WOMAN**, that is bad. As for māyā, she is undoubtedly present in these relationships in the form of false expectations. Therefore, the task of husband and wife, while fulfilling the duties of their āśrama, is to gradually learn to recognize her.

Sense objects have the power to attract and repel, plunging the mind into duality—“good” and “bad.” The family is only a temporary solution to problems, like everything in the material world—it is māyā. But no one can escape it. Every one of us, whoever he may be, was born in a family. If someone wants to reject this, that is also māyā, because there is nothing to renounce—everything belongs to God. Now we must dedicate to His service everything that is within our power. And that which cannot be directly engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service cannot harm us, if we are at least able to engage ourselves in His service.

Whatever we may say, a brahmacārī, when choosing a bride, will see in her an attractive, beautiful—perhaps even indescribably beautiful—young woman. Who she should actually be for him will be reminded by elders—relatives, mentors, and the brāhmaṇa priest during the vivāha-yajña. Infatuation, enchantment, or falling in love is unavoidable. Such is the design of the Creator: the human race must continue. But in order for it to remain human, one must understand the position of **HUSBAND**, **WIFE**, **MOTHER**, and **FATHER**.

Modern psychologists describe husband and wife as sexual psychotypes, analyzing all the details of their relationship. But even without their explanations, people manage perfectly well with the task of mating—this is understandable even to animals. Science is not knowledge of how to eat, sleep, mate, and defend, but of what lies **above** all animal needs. Animals fulfill their needs even better than humans, yet they fight among themselves. Why? Because there is lust—*kāma*. The beginning of the science of relationships is the understanding of peaceful life. The secret of peace is not in the complete absence of kāma, but in not giving it unlimited freedom.

Therefore, between a loving man and woman a lawful marriage is established. Sexual relations outside of marriage are considered unlawful. Kāma, confined within the framework of marriage, works in two ways: as the passion of attraction, and as unsatisfied anger. Therefore, spouses will live in quarrels and reconciliations. Sometimes they will think, “We are so different; he or she does not understand me at all,” but the next moment they will add, “but we have so much in common, and we need each other very much.”

In a family there should be common property and common children, so that it is not so easy to break the family apart. And gradually, by fulfilling one’s duties to God and to family, a person becomes peaceful. Thus kāma is transformed into *prema*—love for God.

This is a difficult and long path. Yet despite this, if a person has already fallen in love and decided to marry, no one will dissuade him. It is harder than pulling a bone from a tiger’s teeth. The Guinness Book of Records describes the story of a loving couple whose relatives on both sides forbade them to marry, and the young people made four attempts at joint suicide—but all were unsuccessful. In the end, the relatives gave their consent.

Being in love helps to create a family. It is a pass into the world of material duties, into the kingdom of varṇāśrama-dharma. But that same infatuation is also the first agent of māyā and can easily lead a person into the world of sense enjoyment, the kingdom of the demons. The scriptures state that demons are very refined in sense enjoyment: they maintain the illusion of happiness by associating with many beautiful women. They take the instability of infatuation to be the variety and brilliance of life. To maintain this brilliance, demons obtain gold and money at any cost, even risking their own lives.

Every brahmacārī, knowing this, feels the risk and therefore may experience fear. But fear is a very bad foundation for creating a family. Fear is a companion of material existence; it comes when māyā covers Kṛṣṇa. From duality arise doubts, from doubts comes uncertainty, and from the absence of faith comes fear for the future. “Will my family life work out or not?” That is the question. Where is the guarantee of success? Young people are not sure of each other, but they want to try. “God grant,” as they say, “happiness to your future family.”

Growing doubts, fear, and lack of faith indicate that a devotee is forgetting Kṛṣṇa. And without faith in the Supreme, all austerities and sacrifices are useless and temporary. Family life may be successful, or it may not be. By the law of karma, the result does not depend on us. The point is not temporary success or failure, but the performance of duty. Therefore, if we are firmly determined to do our duty, there is no need to fear life.

The main thing is to control one’s senses while living family life. In brahmacārī-āśrama it is easier to control the senses because of the absence of sense objects. But that is not the main thing. The main thing is that the brahmacārī must maintain his aspiration for knowledge.

> “These senses, sinful by attachment to sense enjoyment, can be controlled not so much by abstinence as by constant striving for knowledge.”
> — *The Laws of Manu*

In gṛhastha-āśrama one must maintain interest in God, so that it does not turn into a prison or a cunning trap from which there is no way out.

In this sense, there is only one difference between a gṛhastha and a brahmacārī: the gṛhastha must work, have property and money; the brahmacārī must not.

Why is material activity needed? It is needed for yajña, dāna, and tapas. Śrīla Prabhupāda bequeathed to us the building of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, ISKCON. And for this purpose we can work day and night. Why do we expect this from gṛhasthas? Because a brahmacārī does not have—and should not have—the driving force for material activity that a family man has.

Before entering gṛhastha-āśrama, a person should seriously think about his occupation and evaluate himself from the point of view of material qualification. The life of a gṛhastha is connected with varṇa—in other words, with profession. Work is the duty of a householder. Young devotees tend to think that work is not so important. But if we do not understand our duty in the material world, it is difficult for us to understand our duty before God.


## **Varṇa (Profession)**

> “Labor is not a virtue, but a necessary condition for a virtuous life.”
> — Leo Tolstoy

> “So I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me. And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun.”
> — Solomon

Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* that by merely giving up activity one cannot attain perfection. Work is a means of materially maintaining the family and society as a whole, and also the fulfillment of one’s duty to God. The Vedas say that teaching, administration, trade, and physical labor constitute the four varṇas — in other words, the professions to which four types of people are inclined: brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, and śūdras. Work is a way to earn for the needs of the family and also the fulfillment of duty to God and society.

No one should perform another person’s duty, even if he can do it successfully. On the path of self-realization, everyone must be himself; otherwise it is impossible to become a servant of God. By betraying our own nature, we betray the Lord’s plan. Arjuna had to fight because he was a warrior, whom Kṛṣṇa had assigned a central place on the battlefield. If he had refused to fight, he would have lost both his honor and himself.

In our time, professional duty is used like a milking cow — to extract as much profit as possible. This runs counter to the instructions of the scriptures taught in all āśramas. The problem is that āśramas, in the real sense, do not exist in the modern world, and therefore the varṇas are contaminated by human vices.

Imagine a brahmacārī — renounced, austere, pure, well-versed in philosophy — who takes a job and falls under the authority of karmic people. This can be extremely painful for him, and not only because of false ego, but also because he becomes dependent on fallen people. Sometimes the laws of karma work so harshly that a devotee, wishing to associate only with devotees, is forced to associate with materialists, to support the material interests of the collective, to attend their meetings and parties, to receive rewards and punishments. Who would want such a job? Not many. Most will want to avoid such a trap — and this is natural.

Śrīla Prabhupāda gave us a “family business”: preaching, book distribution, prasāda distribution, development of rural communities, farms, schools (gurukulas), and much more. By and large, everything can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service — but only if we act in the mode of goodness.

Śrīla Prabhupāda began his preaching in the modern world at the right time — a world standing at the edge of an abyss, a world deprived of all conditions for virtue.

Sometimes we think that it is impossible: to work and remain in the mode of goodness. But nevertheless, there is no other way, and we must do the impossible.

The movement will gain real momentum only when spiritual knowledge becomes widespread. Already people know about the laws of karma and reincarnation; religiosity is becoming normal; spiritual knowledge is spreading before our eyes, and all of us together can help spread this spiritual culture. This is the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda, of his family in the broad sense, of our families, and of our children and grandchildren. Generation after generation, ISKCON will change the world — and change itself. So many changes are already happening. People today, more than ever, seriously want to understand which religion is true. Practically all religious people are convinced that God is one. Gradually, the world will divide into divine and demoniac natures.

Śrīla Prabhupāda exposed the fraudulent mentality of modern materialistic scientists. In a certain sense, the path before us is completely open. There is nothing unclear about what we need to do.

But in order to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere, we need kṣatriyas, śūdras, vaiśyas, and brāhmaṇas. Yet since many cannot connect their work with spiritual practice — that is, varṇa with āśrama — varṇāśrama as a socio-spiritual culture cannot yet exist. This will become possible only in an atmosphere of mutual respect, love, and care between the representatives of the varṇas.

As for āśramas, in a certain sense we have only one āśrama: service to Guru and Kṛṣṇa. And our spiritual practice is the same for everyone: sixteen rounds of the mantra, the four regulative principles, and the books of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

We are Vaiṣṇavas, and that automatically means that we are brāhmaṇas. And the main duty of brāhmaṇas is to transmit knowledge. If we do not do this, we will create a “shameful caste system.” Devotees of Kṛṣṇa without preaching again become communists or capitalists — that is, they become conditioned only by professional activity, which, giving rise to envy and greed, destroys good relationships.

And although we are not equal among ourselves — as children and parents, poor and rich, foolish and intelligent — before God all are equal. Just as in a family there should be no exploitation of one another, so in the society of devotees everyone has equal rights to speak about Kṛṣṇa, according to time, place, and circumstance. We received this authority from Lord Caitanya, who instructed the brāhmaṇa Kurma to remain where he was, but to speak about Kṛṣṇa to everyone he met.

In varṇāśrama-dharma in former times, all young, inexperienced gṛhasthas were given every opportunity for active work, because experienced and wise people would step aside in due course. Why did such important people step aside? Because for a neophyte, work is a means of progress, but for a wise person, the means is renunciation of material activity. In truth, activity does not stop — it becomes spiritualized. Therefore, elderly people no longer need material occupation; their activity should already be spiritual.

In mature years, a person usually has some savings and grown, independent children, so that he can peacefully devote himself to meditation on the name, qualities, form, and pastimes of the Lord. The duty of a civilized society is to provide this opportunity to everyone, especially to the older generation. The purpose of the varṇas is to serve the āśramas.

Thus, we must master the art of activity in order to become qualified in our work and to work for yajña. Our yajña is the development of ISKCON.

Our goal is not only to create favorable conditions for ourselves and others, but also to return to God. And in this sense, each of us is in the most favorable conditions: we have a great deal of service ahead of us and enormous opportunities to serve Guru and Kṛṣṇa.

When we understand the purpose of the varṇas, then we will be able to understand our life in the position of a gṛhastha, because we will already understand that without varṇa, gṛhastha-āśrama is impossible.


## **Engagement**

> “Marriage, to tell the truth, is an evil — but a necessary evil.”
> — Socrates

> “Marriage is neither heaven nor hell; it is simply purgatory.”
> — Abraham Lincoln

> “In marriage, mutual education and self-education never stop for a single minute.”
> — Vasily Sukhomlinsky

Engagement is preparation for serious relationships. It is a kind of test, a trial for the young people, and the first attempt to consciously build their relationship.

When a young man and a young woman decide to marry, and the elders agree with their decision, an engagement is announced. It is announced not merely for pleasant walks in parks and trips to the cinema. And not just to exchange compliments and play around day and night. Of course, all this will be there — but now it is time to be practical, to see the reality that infatuation hides. One must clearly find out what is in the other person’s mind. Because one cannot love what one does not know. Everyone falls in love, but few want to serve one another. This is how love is tested.

Someone may say, “I love God,” but at the same time not follow God’s laws. The commandments and rules given in the scriptures are the test of one’s love for God. In the same way, the duties performed by husband and wife are the test of their love.

> “No one is compelled to enter into marriage, but everyone must be compelled to obey the laws of marriage once he has entered it.”
> — Karl Marx

Thus, the foundation of marriage is **dharma** — the performance of one’s duties. Marriage is God’s law, and in this lies its mystery. There must be lawful relations between the spouses — that means they accept full responsibility for everything they do in the family. If the law of fidelity and loving care is violated, people receive curses from one another.

> “My daughter is the sister of Priyavrata and Uttānapāda. She is now looking for a husband who will be suitable for her in age and character and who, like her, is endowed with all good qualities.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.22.9

> “O best of the brāhmaṇas, please accept my daughter, whom I offer to you with great faith. She is in all respects worthy to become your wife and take charge of your household duties.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.22.11

> “A wife is meant to assist her husband in every respect, but this is possible only when she is fully suitable for him in age, character, and qualities.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam*, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

During the engagement, which usually lasts six months or a year, the young people should find out what their **common goal in life** is and the **paths** by which they intend to reach it. If the goals are different, then marriage is impossible, and with each day they will drift further and further apart. Sometimes the goals do not coincide, but they are still moving in the same direction — that is better. But ideally, the goal should be one for both.

Then they must find out **how** the future husband and wife intend to walk toward that goal, and what **material needs** each of them has. Perhaps the husband plans to preach and live on donations, while the wife needs a stable income. Or the husband plans to work honestly until old age, and the wife has decided to immerse herself in the mission. Perhaps the husband expects a daily feast prepared by his wife, and the wife thinks it is better to eat at Govinda’s. The husband likes to get up at 3:30 a.m., and the wife only at 6:30. The wife thinks they will have five children and a big house outside the city, and the husband thinks all this is māyā. The wife thinks family life is earthly happiness, and the husband thinks it is a punishment.

The mind of each person is extremely diverse in its desires, and therefore perfect matches simply do not exist. Thus, what remains most important is a **common goal** and a **common determination** to achieve it.

A husband may tell his wife that he plans to return to God in this life and take her with him, but in the morning he cannot be lifted out of bed, and during the day he is also inclined to “rest for better digestion of food.”

Therefore, **common sādhana-bhakti** can bind together even very incompatible characters. Determination in spiritual life helps one endure any difficulties of life.

One yogī was sitting on the bank of the Ganges, meditating under the scorching sun. A fisherman, seeing him again, approached and said, “For a year now I see you sitting here under the burning sun. You should at least build yourself a shelter.” The yogī calmly replied, “Why build anything? I am staying here only temporarily.” Materialists expend enormous effort to achieve a tiny amount of happiness, but the more a family is devoted to God, the less material effort is required to achieve happiness.

We should not forget that the bride and groom are attractive young man and woman who have an intimate interest in each other. During the engagement they should not enter into intimate relations, because sexual connection is **irreversible**. One should remember that the four regulative principles give us complete protection from mistakes and real freedom.

In the surrounding world, people enter sexual relations before marriage in order to test physical compatibility. But when engagement turns into separation, the “used” woman again looks for new relationships in order to create a family and gradually acquires the mentality of a prostitute, not of a wife or a mother. Because a mother and a wife draw their strength from **chastity**.

A man who changes fiancées very quickly loses his sense of responsibility and becomes lustful. Such girls and boys, running from one partner to another in search of a new one, become dangerous for the spiritual development of society.

> “Before marrying the daughter of Svāyambhuva Manu, Kardama Muni considered many circumstances. The most important of them was that Devahūti had decided to marry him alone. She never intended to marry anyone else. This is very important, because the psychology of a woman is such that once she has given her heart to someone, it is extremely difficult for her to take it back.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.22.15, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

## **The Marital Union**

> “Marriage is the first step of human society.”
> — Marcus Tullius Cicero

> “In married life the united pair should form, as it were, one moral person.”
> — Immanuel Kant

**Gṛhastha** — from Sanskrit *gṛha* (house, home, family) and *stha* (situated in, engaged in, devoted to).
**Gṛhastha** means one who is devoted to family life, who lives in a household spirit of service.

> “The word ‘gṛhastha’ (householder) does not at all mean one who simply builds a house. Rather, it refers to a person who has accepted a wife and lives with her in a home. And such a Vaiṣṇava is called a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava. However, a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava does not strive to gratify his senses, and therefore he is in no way similar to sense enjoyers. For a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava, his wife is a servant of Lord Kṛṣṇa, as are his children.
> A gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava becomes happy when his eyes see the Deity of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and things directly related to Him. When his ears hear Kṛṣṇa-kathā or the lives of great Vaiṣṇavas, he feels ecstasy. When he smells tulasī leaves or incense offered to the Lord, he is immediately filled with spiritual bliss. His tongue either serves in nāma-bhajana or tastes the remnants of the Lord’s food. When he touches the feet of a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he feels complete satisfaction.
> His hopes, actions, desires, hospitality, and worship are all components of his service to Kṛṣṇa. His entire life is a continuous celebration of mercy to others, prayer to the Holy Name, and service to the Vaiṣṇavas. Thus a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava is not at all close to sense enjoyers. In the age of Kali, it is most desirable for the soul to become a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava. And by living according to the genuine principles of gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇavas, the soul practically becomes free from the fear of falling down. Moreover, by strictly following this path, anyone can attain the perfection of bhakti. Many Vaiṣṇava gurus are gṛhasthas, and their children are pure devotees. Therefore, association with such gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇavas is a special blessing for living beings.
> Family life of a Vaiṣṇava is a school in which one acquires the necessary experience for realizing the true nature of the soul…
> If he has completely given up the desire for the comforts of family life, he may live in the forest or remain at home — in either case he remains a renounced soul, having nothing to do with material existence. Such a devotee is capable of purifying the entire world!”
> — Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, *Jaiva-Dharma*

A gṛhastha is not a former Vaiṣṇava who, having married, failed to climb out of the well of material existence. He is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa who, by his service to the Lord, can purify the whole world — or, if he is not so powerful, at least purify the small world of his own family.

Different gṛhastha devotees possess different capacities in activity, knowledge, and devotion. Hanumān served Lord Rāmacandra by carrying mountains, while a little spider could move only grains of sand. But the Lord accepted both services equally, and therefore the enthusiasm of the devotees was inexhaustible. For the Lord there is no difference between great and small. Let each of us do what is within our power, and Kṛṣṇa will be pleased with everyone.

A woman is the most powerful and time-tested weapon of māyā. Willingly or unwillingly, she incites a man to enjoy her without higher purpose. A man forgets himself and makes great sacrifices for a woman. Having thus taken away his intelligence, she subjugates him and considers herself successful. The only way for a man to avoid such a fall is to realize that all women belong to Kṛṣṇa and to give them proper protection without falling under their influence.

But since we are not speaking here about mundane relations between man and woman, but about sanctified relations between husband and wife, this is possible only in gṛhastha-āśrama — where the husband must depend on God, engage his wife in His service, and care for her as a servant of the Lord.

Whatever a wife may be, she is a reflection of the thoughts and desires of her husband and has the ability to develop them. For this she only needs to be attractive and know how to serve him. Thus she becomes influential, like fire, and melts the man’s heart. But when the fuel burns out, relationships cool. Life seems to stop and freeze in expectation of a miracle.

But the miracle lies in the fact that **spiritual** relationships between husband and wife are inexhaustible. Just as material desires interact, spiritual desires of man and woman can also interact. One only needs to overcome one’s sinful nature.

> “This young girl, unaccustomed to hardship, out of love for her master followed him into the forest, although the path is difficult. Therefore, O Rāma, please give her happiness. From time immemorial, O joy of the Raghu dynasty, the nature of women has been to stay with a man in prosperity and abandon him in poverty. A woman’s mind is swift like lightning, her words sharp like a sword, her moods like the flight of a kite. Such are women. But your wife is free from sin, worthy of glory, and boundlessly devoted to her master.”
> — Agastya

A fish lives in water, but when thrown onto land it struggles to survive. In the same way, the soul does not live outside Brahman, but being in the material world it struggles for existence. Therefore, a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava must create in his home a **temple of the soul**.

Vaiṣṇava culture, unlike the modern sexual hysteria, is higher, purer, broader, and deeper. It is dazzling — but still poorly studied and not yet fully revealed. An alcoholic thinks about vodka, a drug addict about drugs, and a lusty man about prostitutes. What else can they see or understand?

Husband and wife must live this life together. Their task is to preserve each other’s value. A thing loses its value when it is considered “used.” Therefore spouses must know how to renew themselves from within, renewing each other. This is why gṛhastha-āśrama is created.

> “People forget that marriage is an art and that it must be renewed every day.”
> — Rabindranath Tagore

The relationship of spouses largely depends on the motive of their union and also on the attitude of the parents toward their choice. Did they receive blessings or curses? Was there deceit, calculation, or any other form of dishonesty between the bride and groom or between them and their parents?

In the end, one is deceived only if one wants to be deceived. Therefore, when two deceivers or thieves unite, they should at least be honest with each other. Those who see marriage as a profitable transaction should conclude a contract so as not to forget later why they got married.

But if both spouses are pure, sincere, honest, and open in their intentions, they pass through a sacred ceremony where they give unbreakable vows before God and the society of devotees. In his commentary to the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam*, Śrīla Prabhupāda says:

> “There are eight kinds of marriages, but in this age only one is acceptable — the brāhma or rājasika form. All other forms of marriage — marriage by mutual attraction, by exchanging garlands, or by kidnapping the bride — are forbidden in the age of Kali.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.22.16, purport

Both *Manu-smṛti* and *Āśvalāyana-gṛhya-sūtra* describe eight kinds of marriage. The first four are considered proper and favorable for producing children in goodness; the fifth and sixth are tolerated; the seventh and eighth are condemned:

1. **Brāhma (or rājasika)** — the father gives his daughter in marriage without taking anything in return.
2. **Daiva** — the father gives his daughter to a priest who has performed a sacrifice for the family.
3. **Ārṣa** — the girl is given to a ṛṣi or sage in exchange for a cow or a bull.
4. **Prājāpatya** — the groom formally asks for the hand of the girl.
5. **Āsura** — the suitor pays the father in order to obtain the bride.
6. **Gandharva** — the young people decide to marry by mutual agreement and attraction.
7. **Rākṣasa** — marriage by force; formerly practiced by kṣatriyas, who abducted the girl and then fought her relatives.
8. **Paiśāca** — the man runs away with the girl while her relatives are asleep or negligent; this is completely forbidden, as it is a form of deception.

In Kali-yuga, marrying simply by exchanging garlands or abducting a girl is unrealistic and amounts to fraud. As for love marriages so common today, the scriptures do not especially recommend them for Kali-yuga. Nevertheless, such marriages are permissible if both spouses are pure, sincere, honest, and open in their intentions and in their desire for genuine relationships. Having asked for and received the blessings of elders and spiritual mentors, the young people may sanctify their marriage by a proper ceremony. In this case, elders and mentors act as impartial judges in order to avoid bias or sensual attachment.


## **The Beginning of Family Happiness**

> “One of the most astonishing delusions is the belief that human happiness consists in doing nothing.”
> — Leo Tolstoy

> “If you want to live a happy life, attach yourself to a goal, not to people or to things.”
> — Albert Einstein

The feeling of pure and selfless first love, familiar to everyone, is nothing but a reminder of the soul’s original Love. But the problem is that, passing through the bodily level of mind and senses, it becomes transformed and acquires material qualities. And this kind of love, descending from the spiritual level to the physical, permeates the whole world.

Love on this level depends on the type of senses and mind that each living being possesses in the world of smells, tastes, forms, sounds, and touches. Cats, dogs, birds, insects — all are oriented toward these sensations. Therefore, a person also chooses a wife or husband who corresponds to the desires of his senses and mind. Thus love manifests in the material world, stimulated by fragrance, beautiful form, tasty food, touch, pleasant words, and emotional experiences.

In the Vedas such love is called **sparśa**, which literally means “skin” — bodily, superficial happiness. Such love is like honey in the beginning, but gradually turns into poison.

People become satiated with material happiness, because such is the nature of material senses: they become tired of enjoying the same thing for a long time. Even the most beloved tastes become repulsive if indulged in continuously. Therefore the śāstras say that enjoyment must be regulated by higher knowledge or higher purpose.

When the senses are frustrated, a person feels irritation, not understanding what is needed in order to be satisfied. In this state spouses will inevitably begin to quarrel. Not knowing the higher cause of happiness, they will blame each other for things that recently did not even attract their attention.

For example, the husband may be irritated that his wife often over-salts or under-salts the food; she may disturb him by shuffling her feet around the apartment or taking endlessly long to get ready to go out. And the wife is irritated by the husband’s smacking at the table. A dispute arises over how to squeeze toothpaste: pressing in the middle or rolling the tube from the bottom.

And so, after infatuation comes the stage of quarrels, as a result of which the young spouses begin to think that they are incompatible: “It turns out we are completely different and don’t suit each other at all!” And in the end, when patience is exhausted, the mind and senses cry out in pain: “This is a fatal mistake! We cannot be together — it is better to separate!”

Such is the illusory trap of the mind and senses. Before it is too late, one must turn to the śāstras, to the spiritual teacher, and to one’s own intelligence. A way out is not so difficult to find — but only if the spouses have not insulted each other so deeply that they can no longer forgive. One must remember that we are not merely offending a husband or wife — we are offending a devotee, and perhaps even a saintly person.

The first and most important condition is to learn to **deeply meditate together on the Holy Name of God**. One should chant the Holy Name together in the morning, in ecstasy, feeling new waves of love for God. This process truly unites souls.

The second condition, no less important, is to learn to **make concessions to one another**. By yielding, we create new space for love. One must learn to accept corrections from each other:
“Alright, I will not shuffle my feet, because it irritates my husband and attracts ghosts.”
“I will try to salt more carefully — after all, I am cooking for Kṛṣṇa.”
“And with the toothpaste tube I will simply do it the way my husband wants.”

And the husband, in turn, must agree not to irritate anyone by smacking at the table and realize that such bad habits as biting his nails or sleeping late bind him to ignorance and disappoint those close to him.

These two states of the heart — love for God and love for one’s neighbor — are renunciation of false ego. Although this is accompanied by disagreements and pain, it also increases happiness.

Happiness that is like poison in the beginning but like nectar in the end is real happiness. The poison of fighting each other’s false ego spouses will carry throughout their lives, and having become completely free, they will be endlessly happy. This is the meaning of reasonable concessions that do not contradict the prescriptions of the śāstras.

The rules and regulations of the śāstras are meant to regulate our life through awareness of higher duties, whose ultimate goal is to attain love for God. Such duties must be followed strictly — as law, as duty, as religion, as the path to the highest goal. All these are described in the Vedas by one word: **dharma**.

Dharma is the true foundation for creating a happy family — not infatuation, as most people think.

Infatuation is the **starter motor**; dharma is the **engine**.
The wheels are patience; the headlights are Vedic knowledge.
If the engine is running, the car can go. And if one endures the difficulties of the road and does not lose the way in the darkness, the common goal will surely be reached.

There is **sva-dharma** and **upa-dharma**.
*Sva-dharma* indicates that each of us is a servant of God. This is the eternal position of the soul; it does not depend on gender and applies to all forms of life.
*Upa-dharma* consists of temporary duties toward family, society, and nation, including professional duty.

The platform of happiness in family life is loving service according to the will of God, when a person uses his material nature and social position for that service. But when a person confuses happiness with idleness, his mind sinks into material problems. When he is absorbed in performing his duties, he can think of Kṛṣṇa.

A beginning devotee may think that as soon as he attains love for God, he will no longer need to work or perform any duties. It seems that this is stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.17):

> yas tv ātma-ratir eva syād
> ātma-tṛptaś ca mānavaḥ
> ātmany eva ca santuṣṭas
> tasya kāryaṁ na vidyate

> “But for one who takes pleasure in the self, whose human life is devoted to self-realization, and who is satisfied in the self alone — for him there are no duties.”

But in the next verse (3.18) Kṛṣṇa says that such a person has no reason to abandon his duties:

> naiva tasya kṛtenārtho
> nākṛteneha kaścana
> na cāsya sarva-bhūteṣu
> kaścid artha-vyapāśrayaḥ

> “A self-realized person has no purpose to serve by performing prescribed duties, nor any reason not to perform them. He is not dependent on any other living being.”

Performing one’s duties is always good, at least to set an example for others — especially if you are a great person, because people follow the example of great souls. So what does Kṛṣṇa mean when He says that for one who is satisfied in the self there are no duties?

It means that **a duty which has become one’s desire and need is no longer felt as a duty**. It becomes activity permeated by love.

For example, there is no “duty” to take delicious prasāda two or even three times a day — but everyone does so with astonishing regularity. There is no duty for children to “stand on their heads,” but they never stop doing it. There is no duty to fall in love and get married — yet almost everyone does.

Duties are imposed on those who have no desire to do what is necessary, or who are inconsistent in their activity. But since a person may become tired of family life and want to abandon it, in that case he is reminded of his duties to God and his duty to family, so that he may learn real love in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

## **The Path of Duty and the Greatness of the Human Being**

> “Various Vedic scriptures declare that a woman is a part of her husband; therefore the wise say that a woman is certainly the greatest of gifts.”
> — *Rāmāyaṇa*

> “The wives of heroes do not complain!”
> — *Rāmāyaṇa*

> “Sītā said: ‘Whether poor or deprived of a kingdom, my husband is my spiritual master, and I must follow him.’”
> — *Rāmāyaṇa*

The happiness and greatness of a man and a woman lie in fulfilling their true purpose. The highest position of a husband in the family is to be **guru-pati** — one who gives both spiritual and material shelter. And the highest position of a woman is to be **dharma-patnī** — the embodiment of religious principles and devotion to her husband.

Such spouses free themselves from suffering and are able to free others as well. The position of a guru, father, mother, demigod, or king obliges one to deliver one’s dependents from suffering, raising them to the highest level of love for God.

Without the help of women it is very difficult for men to attain perfection. But women must also know how to protect men from excessive influence over them. When a man, seized by lust, quickly degrades almost to the level of an animal, his whole life may be spent in conflicts with lawful and unlawful women, and then he will have no energy left for higher and more useful activity. He becomes useless both in family life and in society.

Therefore, in Vedic culture the mind and senses of a man were protected by the proper behavior of women. They were not given unrestricted freedom of conduct. A man could not see a woman naked except his own wife. A wife was forbidden to be harsh with her husband, because a woman’s harshness stimulates either the desire to commit violence against her or to look for another woman.

> “As far as women are concerned, they are considered to be the inspiring power of men. In this sense women are more powerful than men. The mighty Julius Caesar was under the control of Cleopatra. Such powerful women are restrained by modesty. Therefore women must be modest. As soon as this regulating valve is loosened, women, by illicit connections, can cause great damage to society. Such connections result in unwanted children, called varṇa-saṅkara, who bring many troubles to the world.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 1.9.9, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

When a man is protected from lust by the intelligent, modest behavior of a woman, he acquires great determination and fearlessness in spiritual life. Then he can be called **guru-pati** — a strong leader who guides others. The Vedas consider him a representative of God. But when he falls under the influence of feminine nature, he becomes like a plush toy in her hands, hoping to receive sexual pleasure in return.

Therefore, for a husband to become a **guru-pati**, a great personality, the wife must become no less great — a **dharma-patnī**.

> “As already explained, a real wife is a dharma-patnī. In other words, a woman married according to religious principles is called dharma-patnī. Children born of a dharma-patnī inherit the property of the father, whereas children born of a woman not married according to religious principles have no right of inheritance. A dharma-patnī is also called a chaste wife. A woman is considered chaste if she has had no contact with any man before marriage. A woman who has freely mixed with men in her youth finds it very difficult to remain chaste, and generally she cannot. If butter is brought near fire, it melts. A woman is like fire, and a man is like butter. But if a man has a chaste wife to whom he is bound by sacred marital ties, she can render invaluable help when he is in danger. In fact, such a wife can become a source of intelligence for him. When a man has a good wife, the whole family engages in devotional service to the Lord, and their home becomes a real gṛhastha-āśrama, the dwelling place of householders devoted to spiritual advancement.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 4.26.16, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

Great people have great goals. A special advantage of a woman’s nature lies in her sensitivity and her ability to foresee events.

A chaste wife can easily and accurately sense with her heart the hidden attitudes of people toward her husband. She is able to warn him of danger in time and protect his reputation. In this sense, a wife is the best adviser, like a minister.

*(Long Sītā–Rāma passage from the Rāmāyaṇa)*

(This passage is rendered in summary rather than poetic line-by-line translation in English editions; it shows Sītā warning Rāma about the subtle danger of unnecessary violence, the influence of weapons on the mind, and the fall of an ascetic who became corrupted by carrying arms. Out of love and concern, she speaks not as a commander but as a devoted wife, asking him to consider his duty, to avoid needless harm, and to remain fixed in righteousness.)*

**(If you want, I can produce a full literary English rendering of this Ramayana passage separately — it is long and deserves its own careful treatment.)**

**Dharma-patnī** is the highest feminine virtue and greatness. Beside such a wife, a man will never be confused by the waves of illusion and will never fall. And beside such a strong husband as **guru-pati**, the wife’s faith in the instructions of the śāstras grows quickly.

Thus, without committing a single sin, they obtain all desirable blessings — both spiritual and material — without creating new karma.

> “Of the four orders of human society — students (brahmacārīs), householders (gṛhasthas), retired persons (vānaprasthas), and renunciants (sannyāsīs) — only the householders are completely safe.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.14.20, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda


## **The Psychology of Man and Woman**

> “In fact, a woman is the energy of a man. History shows that behind every great man there stood either a mother or a wife.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 4.26.15, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

> “A woman who tries to resemble a man is just as ugly as an effeminate man.”
> — Leo Tolstoy

Men and women who do not follow their own nature become unnecessary to anyone. Thus an insoluble problem arises in creating families: men and women physically want to be together, but in practice they cannot really help each other in life.

Being a man or a woman is not a sin; the sin is to forget one’s purpose. Although husband and wife are created for each other, they must act independently, by their own free will, without confusing their duties. That is, a man should never take the position of a woman, and a woman should not imitate a man. Attempts to occupy a position unnatural to one’s nature can cause irreparable harm and even damage the psyche.

A man who imitates a woman weakens in intelligence and becomes infantile, like a child; then a woman may think that life would be much easier without him. And emancipated women lose the sensitivity and subtle power given to them by nature. Therefore, when a woman loses her inner energy of love, she begins to act through external, gross energy, attracting men by her body.

The behavior of men depends greatly on how women behave toward them. A man is quite simple in structure: in his psychology there are only two “buttons” — the button of reason and the button of feelings. This secret switch is protected by masculine dignity, and to get access to this control panel one must charm his heart. Then, feeling trust, he loses his vigilance and his rough masculine force.

The simplicity of his psychology lies in the fact that his reason and his feelings work alternately, depending on where his attention is directed. If at a given moment a man is focused on reason, his feelings “cool down” and stop influencing him. If he is focused on feelings, his reason “cools down” and withdraws. In this there is both a great advantage and a great danger: a man can fulfill his duties without being carried away by emotions, but he can also indulge in pleasures and rest without thinking about tomorrow.

A man is well designed for work and for rest. But he can also become a heartless dictator or a lustful, weak-willed person if he is not reminded in time of his deviations. Therefore, a man needs balanced guidance, which a beloved, loving woman can easily provide.

The reason and feelings of a woman, as modern psychologists say, are much deeper than those of a man. And moreover, they work **simultaneously**. In this there is both a great advantage and a great difficulty. On the one hand, she is capable of seeing things more deeply than a man. On the other hand, it is very difficult for a woman to make decisions, because her reason and feelings work together and often create unbearable contradictions. Therefore, she needs someone nearby who can give her calmness and make decisions.

Until a woman’s reason and feelings receive proper protection, she is not well suited either for work or for rest. Therefore, throughout her life a woman should be under full protection: in childhood she is protected by her father, then by her husband, and in old age by her grown sons. Thus a woman finds in her husband one who, fulfilling his duty, will take care of her materially and spiritually. Wealth, children, respect and honor in society — all this a woman receives from her husband.

And a man finds in his wife one who, in exchange for his care, gives him comfort, pleasure, and when necessary reminds him of his duty. The only exception to these rules are saintly men and women who gain recognition by their holiness.

Even if a husband does not possess high spiritual qualification, proper behavior of the wife helps him gradually rise. For a woman this may be a difficult austerity and even a great sacrifice — to serve her husband as Devahūti served Kardama Muni. But even an attempt to be a real man or a real woman in the family gives amazing results, because by such service the Supersoul is satisfied.

On the path of following one’s nature no one loses. This is a path to God that runs through the heights of existence. Thus, by following their nature, each of the spouses complements the other, and their family union becomes more complete. The śāstras describe different duties of husband and wife according to their nature:

> “O Vidura, by serving her husband, Devahūti was in very close relationship with him, and at the same time deeply respected and loved him, was reserved with him, and pleased him with gentle words.”

**Purport:**
“In this verse two words deserve special attention. Devahūti served her husband with two feelings: *viśrambheṇa* and *gauraveṇa*. In serving the husband, just as in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, these two principles are of primary importance. *Viśrambheṇa* means ‘with intimacy, in a close relationship,’ and *gauraveṇa* means ‘with reverence.’ The husband is the closest friend of a woman, and therefore the wife should serve him as a close friend, but at the same time she should always remember that the husband is superior in position and therefore should show him proper respect.

Male psychology is different from female psychology. The very constitution of a man imposes upon him the desire to dominate the woman, and a woman by her constitution is inclined to submit to the husband. Obeying this natural instinct, the husband tries to establish his leading position in the family, and this order should be maintained. Even if the husband is sometimes wrong, the wife should not contradict him, and then there will never be disagreement between them.

*Viśrambheṇa* means intimacy, but intimacy between husband and wife should not turn into familiarity that breeds contempt. According to the customs of Vedic civilization, a woman should never address her husband by name. In modern society the wife calls the husband by name, but in India this is considered unacceptable.

*Dāmena ca* means that the wife should learn restraint and not give free rein to her feelings even in case of disagreements with her husband. *Sauhṛdena vācā madhurayā* means ‘wishing the husband well and speaking to him with gentle words.’ The material relations a man has to face outside his home cause him many anxieties; therefore at home the wife should receive him with kind words.”
— *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.23.2, purport

One often hears spouses complain about lack of understanding. This is natural, because it is impossible to fully understand a person of the opposite sex. There is no need to deeply meditate on each other’s material nature. Husband and wife are united by some desires and goals, but in everything else they are like beings from different planets. Therefore, when men and women try to fully comprehend each other, they become confused and forget Kṛṣṇa.

Complete understanding between people is possible only on the spiritual level. Therefore, one should always remember that we are not men and women — we are spiritual particles of Kṛṣṇa.

There is no sense in changing roles in an attempt to understand each other’s nature. It is better to meditate on God and peacefully live in His service, experiencing happiness.

Nevertheless, in order to maintain peace, husband and wife must learn to respect each other’s “incomprehensible” nature.

When, for example, a man listens to a woman, deeply entering into her problems, he tries to understand her by comparing her with himself. But since he, as a man, is oriented toward solving problems, he listens as an analyst, using his reason. This is how a man usually tries to constructively sort out his wife’s emotions. But this is almost impossible, because a woman’s feelings are often illogical. Draupadī, having lost her sons, could not sentence their killer to death, because she thought about the grief that his mother would experience.

A man, confused in emotions, may think that his wife’s words are meaningless and not worth special attention. But for a woman, truth is where she is **cherished**, not where correct solutions are proposed while her feelings are ignored.

In other words, only **love** can convince a woman and bring her to balance. Therefore, a husband who does not respond to his wife’s feelings shows disrespect to her.

On the other hand, the wife should not abuse the kindness of her husband and put excessive pressure on his feelings, knowing that, like her, he can become confused in duality — and that is already a big problem for the whole family. That is why Cāṇakya Paṇḍita advised not to trust politicians and women.

When a woman listens to a man, she also tries to understand him by comparing him with herself. In the presence of a woman, a man tends to boast, trying to look stronger and smarter than his wife. And until she emphasizes his superiority, he remains dissatisfied. Therefore, the wife shows him disrespect if she rejects his attempt to be better. But usually a woman thinks: “I know his strengths and weaknesses very well. Why is he saying things that don’t exist?” — and she begins to instruct and argue with him, thereby deeply offending her husband.

But the wife should also not praise her husband excessively by comparing him with other Vaiṣṇavas. In this way she may gradually cultivate false prestige in him and increase his pride.

A wise man is inclined toward simple living and high thinking. The wife, in turn, should accept his way of life and glorify his sincere attempts to advance spiritually.

> “A wife should share the views of her husband. She should be ready to follow the same principles that her husband follows; only in that case will their life together be happy. If a devotee husband lives with a materialistic wife, there will be no peace in the home. The wife should understand what her husband is striving for and be ready to follow him. In the Mahābhārata it is said that when Gāndhārī learned that her future husband Dhṛtarāṣṭra was blind, she immediately began to learn how to live like a blind person. She blindfolded herself and voluntarily began to play the role of a blind woman.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.23.4–5, purport

Thus, family life obliges us to make concessions and compromises. Therefore, so that marriage does not turn into narrow family egoism that disrespects the surrounding world, and so that it does not become as in Krylov’s fable — “Why does the cuckoo praise the rooster? Because he praises the cuckoo” — guests should be regularly received in the home. It is especially good when a saintly sannyāsī preacher visits the house of gṛhasthas.

Service to the devotees of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that it purifies and improves even seemingly hopeless relationships between husband and wife.

Thus, one fault of householders is that they may forget service to God and begin to care only about gratifying each other’s senses. Another fault is that they may stop caring for each other and their relatives under the pretext of serving God.

And yet, if in one way or another they do not abandon devotional service, all their sins are eventually forgiven:

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ

> “Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly, because he is rightly situated.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā* 9.30


## **Civilized Life**

> “The purpose of man is rational activity.”
> — Aristotle

> “Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira asked Nārada Muni: ‘O my lord, O great sage, please be merciful and explain how we, who remain at home without knowledge of the ultimate goal of life, can also easily attain liberation in accordance with the instructions of the Vedas.’

> Nārada Muni replied: ‘My dear King, those who remain at home as householders should act in such a way as to earn their livelihood, and instead of trying to enjoy the fruits of their work themselves, they should offer all these results to Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva. And how to satisfy Vāsudeva in this life can be perfectly understood through association with the great devotees of the Lord.

> A gṛhastha should again and again associate with saintly persons, and with great respect he should hear the nectar of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord and His incarnations, as these are described in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and other Purāṇas. Thus he should gradually become detached from affectionate attachment to his wife and children, just as a man awakens from a dream.’”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 7.14.1–4

People live hiding their income and expenses, behind high fences, having organized for themselves a closed space guarded by locks and dogs. They constantly bring things into their homes and take out only garbage.

Their windows have bars. Their doors are iron, with peepholes and steel chains. Inside the house there is an iron safe and weapons. It is clear that such people live in fear for their life and property.

And their fear is far from unfounded, for they are surrounded by envious people who are always ready to rob them.

At night such envious householders sleep or engage in sex, and during the day they earn money or take care of their family members. Their life passes in these activities.

> **Purport:**
> “Sleeping and sex life at night, and earning money and spending it for the necessities of the family during the day — this is, for the most part, the life of modern society. The philosophy of Bhāgavata condemns this type of human civilization.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 2.1.3

Thus, a man who lives for the sake of accumulating wealth becomes a lifelong watchman of his own house and loses peaceful sleep. His happiness depends entirely on acquisitions and losses.

Civilized life means the **increase of virtue**. If, however, vices such as greed, envy, and irritation develop in society, then despite scientific and technological progress, such a society cannot be called civilized. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that this is merely a society of **polished animals**.

People should be kind, loving, and interested in God. The right to love and to know the Absolute Truth is given exclusively to the human being. Only on the basis of love can a civilized society be built.

So that gṛhasthas do not live exclusively for themselves and for the accumulation of personal wealth, the śāstras prescribe charity and sacrifice.

The highest charitable activity is the **distribution of the science of self-realization**, which leads people to love of God, and from which all other forms of charity proceed — such as care for brāhmaṇas, the elderly, women and cows, care for the sick, the homeless, and the hungry.

As a result of such activity, hostility and suffering in society will be reduced to a minimum.

> “Those who desire to advance in religious life must completely give up all envious behavior toward other living beings in body, words, and mind. There is no religion higher than this.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 7.15.8

Hostility begins with duality, when a person starts thinking of someone as bad and someone as good. And when these two mutually exclusive concepts collide, conflict arises, which often grows into enmity.

But Mahārāja Parīkṣit allowed even the ill-natured Kali to exist in his kingdom — though he did not allow him to rule, he assigned him a proper place.

If envy and hostility between people are removed, then each person will calmly take his place in society according to the guṇas given to him by nature, and there will be no need to threaten each other with destruction.

In Vedic culture, everyone had the right to exist: demigods and demons, caṇḍālas and brāhmaṇas, rich and poor. They knew how to cooperate, because no one claimed another’s position.

Confrontation between people took place only in honest battle or in philosophical debate. The highest place in the varṇāśrama society was occupied by those who possessed knowledge and renunciation — the brāhmaṇas and sannyāsīs.

From them the ruling class of kṣatriyas received guidance — those who could resist aggression and malice by means of administration and personal strength. To maintain peace, kings performed great sacrifices so that everyone, without exception, would receive mercy from above.

The purpose of human life is to **distribute God’s mercy to one another — prasādam**.
One who is hungry should receive food from God.
One who seeks knowledge should receive knowledge from God.
One who seeks protection should receive protection from God.
And one who seeks wealth should receive it from God.

Sanctified food, transcendental knowledge, life according to God’s laws, and wealth received by inheritance or earned by honest labor — all this is God’s mercy and therefore belongs to everyone.

Civilized people exchange these gifts in order to increase friendship and trust.

> “One should offer prasādam to the demigods, the saints, the forefathers, other people, one’s family members, relatives, and friends, seeing each of them as a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 7.15.6

A householder should care for the surrounding people sometimes even more than for his own family. Therefore a gṛhastha-Vaiṣṇava, unlike envious householders, knows that all his property, his home, his family, and he himself belong to God. Therefore it is good when there is a form of God in the home and worship is performed for Him in cleanliness and regularity.

> “Gṛhastha devotees, who are mostly engaged in material activities, must worship the Deity, otherwise they will become victims of material contamination and gradually fall down from the path of devotional service. Deity worship means following all the rules and regulations, by which one can firmly fix himself in devotional service.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 7.5.24, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

This practice tames material desires. We welcome such a path, because **untamed material desires are the only obstacle** on the path of peace and universal prosperity in society.

> “Even if a person is poor, he should not try to improve his material condition simply for the sake of maintaining his body or for becoming known as a great religious man. Like the great python, which lies in one place and gets its food without effort, a person who is free from desires obtains everything necessary for his life without endeavor.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 7.15.15

Only people who are free from desires can live according to the laws of God. And this means that such a society already lives in the **kingdom of God**. We have heard from the śāstras that in the kingdom of God there reigns boundless love, and only there are living beings free from all fear and anxiety.

## **Love**

> “To love is not a disease; the disease is not to love.”
> — Socrates

By the mercy of Lord Caitanya, **everyone without exception** can attain love for God, although it is the most extraordinary and rarest gift. Love is the **absence of offense** on the level of mind, speech, and action. This means complete purification, and as a result it brings pure, unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa. It does not arise from desire for fame, profit, or recognition. **Self-interested love is offensive.** Love is a complete and perfect state. Nothing can be taken away from it without harming it, and nothing can be added to it in order to improve it.

Love never dies and never leaves us — it **sleeps in our heart**, because it is humble and patient. But where offenses are committed, there is no place for love.

> “Love of God is an extraordinary gift. Rūpa Gosvāmī offered his obeisances to Caitanya Mahāprabhu because He distributed love of God, Kṛṣṇa-prema, to everyone without exception. Glorifying Lord Caitanya, Rūpa Gosvāmī called Him mahā-vadānya, the most munificent incarnation of the Lord, because He freely gave love of God, which the sages attain only after many, many lifetimes. Kṛṣṇa-prema, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the most precious gift we can bring to those whom we truly love.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.23.8, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

For divine love to awaken, **four components** are necessary: the name of God, the form of God, His qualities, and His pastimes. In the material world, all of these are distorted and concealed. Knowing nothing about Kṛṣṇa, people are attracted to the names, forms, qualities, and activities of one another. Ignorant people use them to **imitate God**, to play His role, and love becomes largely an external, anxious, confused game with bad consequences for the soul. Therefore many people consider love to be merely deception.

For example, the name of God cannot be deceptive, because it is non-different from God Himself, whereas a person’s name is not identical with his personality. The body of God is not different from His inner essence, but the human body is different from the soul. And because a discrepancy arises between the soul and the human body, the love sleeping deep in the heart also falls into a world of discrepancies. It is unbearably painful for it in an atmosphere of profit, greed, and envy. It suffers and waits for the moment when the soul will be given freedom and permission to act — with its eternal name, form, qualities, and activities.

Man, like God, also has these four components, because he is created in His image and likeness. Man is a tiny, distorted reflection of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa dances in Vṛndāvana, and man dances in nightclubs. Kṛṣṇa steals butter in Gokula, and man steals money. Kṛṣṇa enjoys with many gopīs, and man also wants to associate with many women. Kṛṣṇa plays the flute to bring happiness to His devotees, and man also plays musical instruments to entertain his admirers. The only difference is that when Kṛṣṇa does this, He increases the bliss of **all** living beings, whereas man does it only for his own satisfaction. Therefore, to be happy, one must hear about the pastimes of the all-good and unlimited Kṛṣṇa. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Sītā-Rāma, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa are divine manifestations of the perfection of love, and one who comes into contact with them is infinitely fortunate.

*(Here follows the long poetic passage from the Rāmāyaṇa — it should be preserved in elevated, literary English; I will polish it separately as a poetic block if you want. For now, conceptually we keep it as is.)*

This is so similar to human feelings, so close to us, that it seems there is nothing here that is incomprehensible. Love is knowable to any person, and even to any living being it is not foreign, but **its summit is unattainable**, because it is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa themselves, who are transcendental. A person can learn to love people properly as extensions of Kṛṣṇa’s energy — especially those who are close to him, because they are given to us by God for special care. The scriptures say that husband and wife, crossing the ocean of birth and death, sail in the same boat.

> *(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 4.26.17 purport — translated faithfully in the spirit of Prabhupāda’s language)*
> “A woman must always be under the protection of her husband… Therefore she is called ardhaṅgī — ‘half the body’… A man cannot live properly with only one half of his body… The home must be a place of devotional service, the wife must be chaste, and the marriage must be sanctified by religious ceremony. Only then can a man be truly happy in family life.”

Family people very much need to come into contact with **beauty** — as it appears in people, in the wondrous manifestations of nature, and in other creations. But **true beauty never awakens lust** in the heart of a person; on the contrary, it elevates our thoughts and desires to the transcendental level. This is the purpose of art and culture.

Talents, astonishing human abilities, beauty, and wealth are meant for devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. He is the source of all beauty, including feminine beauty. Therefore Kṛṣṇa can be seen everywhere — but this is a great science that must be carefully learned.

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes about feminine beauty in an unusual way:

> *(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 4.26.23 purport — essence preserved)*
> “The beauty of the queen is compared to the beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness… When one restores his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he becomes truly steady and reaches the goal of life.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda compares the beautiful features of a woman to the beautiful features of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which makes a person firm and capable of reaching the goal of life.

Beauty is the **most powerful weapon**. As soon as a person learns to understand and feel beauty, he immediately falls captive to it. The beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so unsurpassed that all the beauties of this universe are only **signposts** pointing in its direction.

Indeed, in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement people come who are beautiful and not so beautiful, but having received initiation from the spiritual master and acquired brāhminical qualities, **all of them radiate a special inner beauty**. Śrīla Prabhupāda was irresistibly attractive to young Americans in his seventies. Such is the beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The beauty of a woman is one of Kṛṣṇa’s treasures. The most exalted and intimate servants of Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual world have feminine forms and act as His consorts. Such is the nature of conjugal love — to give pleasure to the Supreme Lord through glances, gait, the sound of the voice, and so on. This means that all women in this world can become great devotees of Kṛṣṇa if they engage their beauty and other feminine qualities in His service. Therefore, when a man has a wife who is a devotee, by her service to Kṛṣṇa, guru, and her husband, she easily attracts the Supreme Lord into the home.

A man is naturally attracted to feminine beauty, but he must learn to look at beautiful married women **without a sense of ownership**. Such love is an expression of deep respect.

> “Listening to Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa said: ‘I do not recognize her ornaments or earrings, but I recognize her ankle bells, because I worshiped her feet.’”
> — *Rāmāyaṇa*

Only conjugal love contains **all possible rasas** of relationship; therefore, between husband and wife everything is allowed: they can be friends, care for each other like parents, fulfill each other’s desires, quarrel and be jealous. They can even fight. But love for married women and married men must **not** be expressed in the same way.

To love other people properly requires powerful protection from the contaminating influence of kāma — this is **great humility, tolerance, and respect**. At the same time, a person should not demand any respect for himself.

Thus, if one learns to properly love all those who are close or attractive to him, this will certainly bring him closer to God, because it helps develop spiritual qualities. The spiritual master teaches his disciples love through humility, tolerance, and respect. Such love is never contaminated by kāma.

Śrīla Prabhupāda said that **prema and kāma are forty miles apart**.


## **Lust**

> “Many fools regard marriage as a simple union. That is why, after the wedding, they treat this union lightly.”
> — Rabindranath Tagore

> “Modern society has achieved so much in material progress only because restrictions and prohibitions on various forms of sexual pleasure have been removed. This is especially noticeable in Western countries.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 4.26.26, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

> “Svāyambhuva Manu was among the pious kings. Although he was absorbed in material enjoyment, he did not fall to the bottom of life, because he enjoyed material happiness in an atmosphere permeated with Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”
> **Purport:** Material enjoyment in royal life often leads a king to degradation: having unlimited opportunities for sense gratification, he descends to the level of an animal. However, Svāyambhuva Manu is counted among the great sages because in his state and in his home the atmosphere of Kṛṣṇa consciousness prevailed. The same situation applies to all living beings: conditioned souls come into the material world to satisfy their senses, but if, by worshiping the Deity in the temple or at home, they create around themselves an atmosphere of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as described here and as prescribed by the śāstras, then even while enjoying material life they can undoubtedly reach the platform of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Modern people are very strongly attached to the materialistic way of life, that is, to sense enjoyment. But the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement gives people the opportunity to fulfill the mission of human life without renouncing material enjoyment. Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not demand that a person completely suppress his tendency toward sense gratification; it simply **organizes and regulates** his habits in the sphere of enjoyment. Even while continuing to enjoy material benefits, a person can, already in this life, attain liberation if he develops Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And this can be done by the simple method of chanting the holy names of the Lord:
> *Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare / Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.*
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.22.34

Modern culture is arranged in such a way that it is easy for men to focus on **many women at once**. Advertising, shop windows, television, and glossy magazines are flooded with images of beautiful women ready to smile at every man, and thus they become easily accessible.

The presence of beautiful women excites the male mind, and a person becomes energized for pleasure; in anticipation of it, the atmosphere becomes elevated and even “creative.” Almost any material object becomes attractive if it is in the hands of a beautiful woman or made of pure gold. **Gold and women** are the main sources of inspiration in the world of people and things. And such a form of inspiration is called **kāma**, or lust.

But kāma represents only a **superficial view** of the objects of the senses. For example, the body of a beautiful woman can be seen from different points of view. A spiritual person will see in it the soul — in other words, the personality. A doctor will see the body as a place for diseases. An inspired poet or artist may see in it a nymph woven of sunlight. A practical person will assess how functional this body is. But a lustful man will perceive only forms and smells. His view will be the most superficial and primitive — like the view of an animal.

If husband and wife form a family on the basis of kāma, then undoubtedly it will develop only up to the limits of their morality and conscience. However, the pressure of kāma is so powerful that it can **change moral principles** and is capable of coming into conflict even with conscience itself.

For example, if spouses give full freedom to their lust, then lust, like a growing fire, will spread **beyond the family**. Then lawful marital relations will seem boring, and a person will begin to be attracted to and inspired by illicit relationships. In Western countries this has become a common phenomenon. Therefore kāma gets the opportunity to spread further: under the influence of passion people begin to take interest in same-sex relationships, finding many “philosophical” and “moral” justifications for their lust.

And then, like a raging element, kāma goes further — people can lose the distinction between mother and son, father and daughter, brother and sister…

Then perverts, sadists, cannibals, and murderers appear.

And all of this is the result of lust.

In the end, when a person exhausts all enjoyment to the last drop but still does not become happy, he feels such **disappointment and hatred** toward the world that he wants to kill himself. Of course, he can kill himself at any stage of dissatisfaction — for one can perish not only in a great fire, but even from burns. Such is the danger of the all-devouring fire of kāma.

Indeed, many developed Western countries, where people are given freedom and all opportunities for sense enjoyment, become leaders in the number of suicides. Their lives have been made meaningless by lust.

> “Thus the pure consciousness of the wise living being is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā* 3.39

But even a person driven by lust to the very edge of destruction **can be saved** by giving him Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because **prema is stronger than kāma**.

To a debauchee, real love — with its fidelity and fulfillment of duty — seems like a prison sentence. But in reality, it is kāma itself that punishes a person.

Even in the process of spiritual practice, lust will for a long time continue to disturb him, making faces of envy, anger, criticism, and malice. Kāma is strong, but it has one serious weakness: **it has no support from God**. Therefore, however difficult spiritual life may seem, with divine support it becomes pleasant and easy — because spiritual life is directly opposite to lust.

The great mahājana Bhīṣmadeva advised all people to develop nine qualities: not to become angry, not to lie, to distribute wealth impartially, to forgive, to conceive children only with one’s lawful wife, to keep mind and body clean, not to bear enmity toward anyone, to be simple, and to care for one’s servants and dependents.

To a lustful, greedy, and envious person, it seems that these instructions are good for others — but not for him. It seems to him offensive and outrageous to demand such things from him and to give him such advice.

Kāma is a **hurricane of feelings** that has only one goal: at any cost to seize the desired object, without regard for its will.

Thus Rāvaṇa abducted Sītā, who shed endless tears in separation from her divine husband. The “love” of Rāvaṇa was a great offense to Sītā and Rāma. Any man who feels lust toward women becomes the cause of their tears and the suffering of children. **Women and children are protected by love, not by lust.**

> “Be very careful not to become the cause of a woman’s tears, for the Lord counts her tears. Woman was created from man’s rib. Not from his feet, to be trampled upon. Not from his head, to be above him. But from his side, to be equal. Under his arm, to be protected. And near his heart, to be loved.”
> — Talmud

Lust can manifest itself both in **unrestrained sense gratification** and in **false renunciation**, practicing demonic austerities that go as far as self-torture. Therefore both austerities and enjoyments must be regulated by the instructions of the śāstras.

This material world is created by the Lord to give conditioned souls the opportunity to realize their lustful inclinations. But when they finally reach a complete dead end because of endless activity for the sake of satisfying lust, they begin to take interest in the true position of the soul.

Emperor Svāyambhuva Manu enjoyed royal luxury and family life, but in an atmosphere permeated with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. **Material desires, when engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, become harmless.**

> “In other words, both lust and anger, when used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, turn from our enemies into our friends.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā* 3.37, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda


## **Children — Reward and Punishment**

> “The witch Pūtanā always wandered about looking for the blood of children, and with that desire she came to kill Kṛṣṇa. But because she offered her breast to the Supreme Lord, she attained the highest perfection. What then can be said of those who had natural maternal love and devotion for Kṛṣṇa and who offered Him their breast and many precious gifts, as a mother offers something to her child?”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.6.35–36

We choose our wife or husband according to our desire or love. **But children come to us as they come, and we must love them as they are.** One does not choose one’s children, just as one does not choose one’s parents. Children may be good or bad, but parents love and accept them in any condition.

This is the special position of parents — **to love a child even if he does not respond in kind**. Such love is purer than conjugal love, because it demands nothing in return; it is selfless and pure. Many parents, especially mothers, behave like saints. Their conduct touches the heart, for for the sake of a child a mother can easily sacrifice her own life.

In the winter, in the wilderness of the Urals, a young mother stood at a bus stop near the forest with her child in her arms, waiting for a bus. Suddenly wolves appeared. To save the child from the pack, the woman threw him onto the roof of the concrete shelter of the bus stop, and she herself perished. A few minutes later a bus arrived, and people saw the tragedy — the torn body of the woman and the crying child above.

A mother worries about her child even when she herself is seriously ill or very old. She thinks about him almost constantly when he needs something and experiences his pain as her own. Such is the deep attachment between parents and children. Therefore many great devotees — such as Vasudeva and Devakī, Mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja, Kardama Muni and Devahūti — performed severe austerities in order to obtain the honor of having the Supreme Lord as their son. In such a case a person attains the state of yoga without any artificial effort, and the connection with God becomes complete.

Ordinary people give birth to ordinary children. The apple does not fall far from the apple tree. **Children embody both the sins and the virtues of their parents.** If spouses have only a small stock of piety, it is difficult for them to love even each other for long. Love without piety is extremely capricious and impatient.

If a newborn comes into such a family atmosphere, instead of great joy he may evoke fear: so many troubles day after day, from morning till night and from night till morning! For what? What kind of person will he be — who knows? Fear and anxiety for the child are sometimes taken for love, but in fact the child does not need our fears and anxieties. He awaits **joy and understanding**; he wants to be happy **right now**.

Nevertheless, by caring for the infant and serving him, parents accumulate some piety and become kinder. Thus, gradually, in the process of service and care, love grows.

Then the child grows, his activity and needs increase, and parents have to apply even more effort and attention to educate him. Later the child gets friends whom he will love — and the parents will have to love them too. Then the young man will bring a bride into the house. Perhaps she will not be to everyone’s taste, but she too will have to be accepted as a relative. Then come grandchildren. How quickly time flies! The family tends to expand.

Grandchildren will also grow up, then great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren will appear… If a person lives to 120 years, then all people are like children to him — he looks at everyone equally. Brahmā is our original forefather. For him there is no difference between demons and demigods — all are his children. And ultimately **we are all children of one God**. He is the source of everything.

But if parents raise a child **within the narrow limits of their own family**, independently of human society, then the child will feel cut off from the world, and suspicion and misunderstanding of others will develop in him. A person must learn the science of relationships and understand human nature. Whatever a person may be, **virtue can be awakened in anyone’s heart**. This is the art of communication.

Dhṛtarāṣṭra loved his malicious son Duryodhana, but could not extend this love even to other members of his own family. Under the pressure of attachment to his son, he was forced to persecute the Pāṇḍavas. As a result of long and complex politics, Dhṛtarāṣṭra destroyed the kingdom and lost his entire family.

Therefore devotees of Kṛṣṇa must be **careful in their love for their children**. One must remember that every child must be useful to society. Therefore education should be reduced to teaching children to **do good to others even at their own expense**. But the material nature of parents is such that they want their children to live **for themselves**. Such families destroy society and cause irreparable harm.

> “By raising love for her cubs, a cobra does not become less poisonous.”
> — Avessalom Podvodny

This is the egoism of parents — to love their own family **at the expense of others**. In the gṛhastha-āśrama, devotees remember well that they live in **one great family of Kṛṣṇa**. And in order for Kṛṣṇa to be pleased, devotees never harm one another. In every family people can live peacefully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and teach this to their children. **There is no other science of education.**

Only one who has love for God can give it to others. Therefore the main thing that makes a person worthy to have children is **sincere devotion to God**.

Of course, to have a good husband or wife, good children, one must have merits from the past. Sunīti, the mother of Dhruva Mahārāja, told her son that she was unable to protect him from his stepmother, the king’s second wife, because she was not the king’s beloved wife. Sunīti admitted that this happened because in past lives she had not rendered devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. Now she told Dhruva that if he would turn to God, then God Himself would protect him.

The queen acted correctly by showing her son the right path, thanks to which Dhruva attained the perfection of life. In due course she was fully rewarded. **To have such a God-devoted son is the greatest reward.**

On the other hand, the father of King Vena, despite all his piety and great merits, could not cultivate in his bloodthirsty son any attachment to Kṛṣṇa. In the end he retired to the forest and attained perfection himself, and Vena perished by the curse of the brāhmaṇas.

But from the dead body of Vena the brāhmaṇas created something astonishing: by churning his body, they managed to separate **sin and virtue**, which had been mixed in the king. When sin was separated, a black, small, and ugly man appeared, weak in intelligence and ready to serve anyone. Such is sin without the support of virtue — **depravity and weakness**.

But then, when virtue was separated, **the great King Pṛthu** appeared, immediately together with his wife. He was so pure and exalted that he did not even have to look for a wife — they appeared simultaneously.

## **In the Age of Kali**

> “Bhīṣmadeva, the best of the eight Vasus, received and welcomed all the great and powerful ṛṣis who had assembled there, for he perfectly knew how to apply all religious principles according to time and place.”

**Commentary:** Those who truly know religion understand how to apply its principles according to place and time. All great ācāryas (teachers of religion and reformers of the world) fulfilled their mission by adapting religious principles to specific circumstances of time and place. In different parts of the world there are different climates and conditions, and one who preaches the Lord’s message while performing his duty must know how to do this according to the particular place and time.

— *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 1.9.9

The most important thing in gṛhastha-āśrama is **to apply transcendental knowledge according to time, place, and circumstance**. The circumstances surrounding us are far from Vedic. The mode of goodness in the age of Kali is practically absent in real life, although on the level of the mind every person feels himself to be wise.

In life we come very close to the modes of passion and ignorance, which specifically influence spiritual practice. We bring into the pure process of bhakti **all the defects inherent in Kali-yuga**, and therefore, first of all, real spiritual life removes the veil of illusion from us and shows us **ourselves without embellishment**. We will see that in fact we are much more representatives of Kali than representatives of God.

Then many years will be needed to uproot low habits and inclinations which we had long carefully hidden even from ourselves. Dressing everything bad in good clothes, we were proud of our own vices. Thus we did all our deeds — including creating families.

The spiritual master and the śāstras open our eyes. In the impenetrable darkness of Kali we have a torch of knowledge that reveals the true face of Kali-yuga:

> “Men and women will live together merely because of superficial attraction, and success in business will depend on deceit. Femininity and masculinity will be judged only according to sexual skill, and a man will be known as learned only if he wears a sacred thread.
> A person’s spiritual position will be ascertained merely from external signs, and on the same basis people will change from one spiritual order to another. A person’s qualities will be seriously doubted if he does not earn enough money. And one who is very clever in juggling words will be considered a learned scholar.
> A man will be considered irreligious if he has no money, and hypocrisy will be taken as virtue. Marriage will be established simply by verbal agreement, and a man will think himself fit to appear in public if he has merely bathed and put on fine clothes.”

— *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 12.2.3–5

In the age of Kali, even a person who has studied the scriptures **cannot attain liberation**, because without pure intelligence he does not understand how to apply the Vedas in practice. Knowledge not embodied in life develops great pride and self-love, as a result of which a person begins to analyze and criticize the scriptures as if they were written by ordinary people.

Thus, having “found flaws” and “exposed contradictions” in the Vedas, such a person fails to understand their main conclusion — **his relationship with Kṛṣṇa**. Therefore in Kali-yuga many great scholars, even those who have studied the Vedas, do not come to devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, but merely defend academic degrees for the sake of awards and fame.

But if they, as scholars, applied in practice even one or two spiritual instructions, their lives and the lives of many others would change greatly for the better. However, not having spiritual strength coming from paramparā, they cannot practice such things as **giving up false ego, accepting a spiritual master, humility, and control of the senses**.

And since it is difficult for them to follow the direct Vedic path, they are busy opening many detours and false paths, relying on people’s sinful desires and needs. In short, the path supported by modern science is **not the exposure of sinful activity and not renunciation of it, but the struggle with its unavoidable consequences**.

This way of life has now entered every family and every modern person. Of course, by this path it is impossible to get rid of suffering in any family.

Once I attended a lecture by an educated woman who was explaining how dangerous fish is to eat. The audience was so frightened by parasites and botulism that some listeners began to say aloud: “Why do we need fish at all?” To this the scholar replied that properly prepared fish is very tasty and healthy, and therefore we just need to take all precautions in order to eat it safely.

She was offering a **compromise — a detour in life**. But the direct path is that a person does not need fish at all, and therefore does not need a science describing its use.

Thus, gradually, materialistic science has led humanity into a dead end. Things that no one truly needs, and moreover from which people receive serious harm, occupy a key place in the economy: production of alcohol, slaughterhouses and meat plants, gambling houses and drug trade, and the sex industry. All this, strangely enough, is supported by modern science.

How? Very simply — by the same concept: **it is possible and useful to sin, provided you know how to avoid the consequences**. There is no Supreme Witness of your sins and cannot be. Therefore, if no one saw the sin committed, then it simply does not exist. And when everyone sins in secret and knows about it, then this is no longer sin but a legally recognized norm.

For example, if husband and wife use sex mainly for pleasure, this is sinful. Therefore there will be consequences — unplanned, unwanted children. To avoid this, they use contraceptives. This is another sin, which deprives both man and woman of dignity and turns both into sex-machines. Sex becomes more important than the birth of a good child, and this principle already puts the very value of marriage in question. If milk can be bought at the market, why keep a cow?

Thus, modern education of family people is incomplete. From the point of view of practicality and professionalism it may be useful, but from the point of view of purity and morality it is very harmful.

**True science is the ability to recognize and avoid sin**, because a real scholar knows that the Supreme Witness exists. But now no one really teaches this science, and therefore intoxication, illicit sex, gambling, and meat-eating flourish.

People hope that science or politics will make them happy in the future. But it is precisely as a result of modern science and politics that **even their beloved families have become a source of suffering**.

*Psychologist’s Note*

What is the family like in the age of Kali? The institution of family practically does not exist. Today, according to official statistics, about **80% of families** break up in highly developed countries.

Twenty years ago, in schools, children from single-parent families could be counted on fingers; they were considered children from troubled families, and teachers were advised to pay special attention to them because of psychological trauma and instability. Today **more than half** of schoolchildren are from such families, and no one considers it necessary to pay special attention to this, taking it as normal.

Not long ago it was considered indecent when a woman said she was married for the second time, but now modern youth are proud of the number of marriages. In Kali-yuga this is considered a sign of demand and popularity.

An entire generation has grown up in broken families, where men and women did not receive proper education and were not taught how to show patience, respect, and humility. On the contrary, in the family they learned how to quarrel, how to insist, resist, avoid, leave, withdraw, condemn, and take offense. All this experience is brought into their own family, where often the same old scenario unfolds.

A man raised without a father often cannot show willpower; he is either excessively sentimental or, on the contrary, emotionally closed. He often becomes dependent on his wife, becoming “henpecked,” or, on the contrary, does not trust his wife, unconsciously projecting his childhood grievances onto her.

Women who grew up in divorced families are also very wary of men, carrying inside the idea: “I can live without you.” Such people find it much easier to divorce than to continue living together. Statistics show that the number of years lived in marriage is rapidly decreasing. Cases are not rare when spouses divorce after living together only a few months, or even days. In Kali-yuga people are not inclined to tolerate others — just as they are not inclined to change themselves.

Special attention should be given to the unwillingness of people in Kali-yuga to serve one another with the arrival in our homes of the fruits of technological progress: washing machines, microwaves, dishwashers. Our homes have lost the desire for **joint housekeeping**, although it is precisely **joint activity and joint service** that bring people together.

Our homes have become stuffed with technology that freed up much time, which we thought we would spend on more elevated things — but the freed time is spent on the same claims, quarrels, or sitting in front of the TV.

The ability of a housewife to cook and clean faster thanks to modern technology did not lead to a greater desire to invite guests and cook for them. On the contrary, “fast food” has become more common — food prepared in haste — and relationships themselves have begun to resemble fast food: quick, superficial, dry.

In short, the age of Kali has brought into family life far more mutual claims, reproaches, accumulated resentments, desire to blame the other, unwillingness to make concessions. Families have become more isolated, there is less deep contact, more desire to enjoy at another’s expense, to squeeze as much as possible from one’s partner. The family by the principle “my home is my fortress” has turned for many into a field of chronic warfare with rare truces.

---

Since the wrong way of life is supported by the authority of modern science, the first thing that must be done is **to protect the family from sinful activity**.

A family will be completely safe physically and morally only when people learn to live without illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling. Of all this, sex can be accepted **only for the conception of desired children** — that is the ideal.

Excessive sex is excessive expenditure of psychic and physical energy, which ruins the offspring. Therefore generation after generation people become morally weaker and weaker. Physical strength and resistance to disease also decrease. Sexual energy is very valuable and powerful; it is not recommended to waste it.

Some people consciously become monks in order to gain inner strength and accelerate spiritual development, but this is an ideal very far away in Kali-yuga, when most people have devoted their most valuable years to sexual enjoyment.

Now people cannot be stopped. Their beauty, intelligence, culture, and work serve sex. Without it, modern life would lose its meaning. One can safely say that materialistic society has gone mad from sense enjoyment, just as it once happened in ancient Rome before its fall.

**In Kali-yuga there is no other path to God except chanting His Holy Name.**

In Kali-yuga people are bound by material desires like everything is bound by cold in winter. The cold of lust penetrates into the very hearts of people of this age and kills spiritual and even simply human feelings. The heart becomes cold like ice.

But anyone who simply chants the Holy Name, without pondering the twists of Kali-yuga, **will certainly in time be freed from the tendency to sin**.

Śrī Caitanya calls to us:
**“There is no other way! There is no other way! There is no other way!”**
This is the essence of all the Vedas.

Thus, the most important thing in Kali-yuga is **to extract the very essence of the Vedas and apply it in practical life**. Then people can be saved from everything unfavorable and acquire pure love for God in their hearts. Then they will create strong families capable of supporting peace in society.

But the present reality is that very many already have **wrong families**, formed before meeting true knowledge received from the spiritual master. And often the members of such families do not support and do not share the resolute spiritual aspirations of the devotees, and therefore serious conflicts arise that put the family under threat.

We see how the golden standards of the Vedas, pure and sinless life, can turn out to be **destructive for a family built on a sinful way of life**. Such is the reality of Kali-yuga.

So what does it mean — that most people in Kali-yuga have no choice at all? We cannot move to another age, we cannot change Kali-yuga itself.

Truly, **God could not be called compassionate and all-good if He had not given medicine for Kali-yuga.**


## **Hearing About Kṛṣṇa — The Medicine Against the Influence of Kali-yuga**

> “By the supreme will of the Lord, such people are marked with the seal of a curse. Because they have turned away from the nectarean narrations of the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are compared to hogs who eat stool. Instead of hearing about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, they listen to stories about the sinful activities of materialistic people.”

**Commentary:** There is no person in the world who does not like to listen to stories about the lives of others—politicians, rich men, or fictional heroes of literary works. The world is literally flooded with meaningless novels, stories, and the writings of self-made philosophers. Materialists eagerly read such works, but when books containing true knowledge fall into their hands—*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam*, *Bhagavad-gītā*, *Viṣṇu Purāṇa*, or other sacred scriptures such as the Bible and the Qur’an—they do not awaken any interest in them.

By the will of Providence, such people bear the mark of a curse. Their fate is no better than that of a hog. Hogs love stool more than anything else. If you offer a hog a delicious dish made from condensed milk and ghee, it will turn away from it and go in search of foul-smelling excrement, which seems to it wonderfully tasty.

The same curse hangs over materialists, who find taste in narrations about hellish activities but remain indifferent to the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Narrations about the Lord’s pastimes are **the purest nectar**, and all other works that may attract our attention are, in fact, **poison**.

— *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.32.19

In our age, people do not like to listen to instructions addressed to them. When they are told the truth, it often offends their feelings. Even after hearing the truth, they value their own opinion more, because it is more pleasant.

Therefore, in families it is practically impossible to establish a proper hierarchy of peace. A man and a woman try to control one another by means of sexual attraction—again, because it is pleasant. Later, when their senses become dissatisfied, they experience strong irritation and anger and may quickly separate because of the aversion that has appeared.

Their “love” resembles the behavior of a predator. While a lion is full, he is peaceful; but as soon as he is hungry, he becomes extremely dangerous.

Therefore, for spouses to make the mind satisfied, they must learn to **receive spiritual nourishment**—by speaking about the nature of God, His aspects, forms, and pastimes, and by regularly and attentively hearing about them.

Without spiritual practice that raises consciousness above the time and space of Kali-yuga, **any family life is doomed to defeat**. Who can cross the ocean of the vices of Kali-yuga in a leaky boat of lust? Only gṛhasthas who follow the instructions of the Vedas given for our time can count on growth and success.

Otherwise, even a small, innocent piglet of sin will grow into a big, dirty hog right in our own home.

Fortunately, following spiritual practice now is not difficult at all, because there are **no strict rules** for chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

Our Earth, Bhūmi, suffered from excessive wars and evil. Kṛṣṇa came in that difficult time not in order to suffer like an ordinary man along with everyone else, but **to enjoy His internal energy together with His beloved devotees**.

His devotees who lived in Vṛndāvana enjoyed with Him, despite the displeasure of King Kaṁsa and the intrigues of demons. Then He gathered all the military forces on the field of Kurukṣetra, and His devotee-warriors won the battle. Thus Kṛṣṇa restored dharma and family traditions that had begun to crack. The honor of Queen Draupadī was restored.

In the same way, **by accepting the Name of Kṛṣṇa**, we will begin to feel transcendental happiness within ourselves, regardless of the environment, because Kṛṣṇa will accept us into His family and spread the atmosphere of Vṛndāvana to everyone.

Demons will not be able to harm one who is under the protection of the Name of Kṛṣṇa. Then, when the Holy Name spreads more widely, the world will be divided into godly people and those who are against the Personality of Godhead.

Those who act according to their own whims, without support from above, will cause irreparable harm to themselves. The family of Kṛṣṇa will be victorious, because He is **Ajita—the Unconquerable**.

In fact, **every family belongs to God**, but in our age it is difficult for people to understand this, because the place of God has been taken by man.

As soon as we give Kṛṣṇa His rightful place, **He will immediately drive Kali-yuga out of our home**, and we will live in the atmosphere of Vaikuṇṭha—fearlessness and happiness.

This is the advantage of Kali-yuga: **simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, one can get rid of all the bad influences of the age and, while living at home, live in the atmosphere of a temple**.

In a temple everyone comes as a guest and a servant, and therefore they feel happiness chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. But at home, every householder develops a sense of ownership and behaves like the master and lord of his relatives. This is the cause of conflicts.

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura wrote:

> “My home, my wife, my children, and I myself—all this is Yours, my Lord.”

The main thing is to remember that **we are servants of God, not lords of this world**.

A family that does not accept the authority of the scriptures is more like a snake’s hole. To avoid misfortune, one must **every day hear the spiritual message of the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and chant the Holy Names together**.

Gradually, we will remember who we really are and **why we live together**.

Just as you want those close to you to understand you and forgive your shortcomings and mistakes, in the same way you must become someone close, understanding, and forgiving to another. Otherwise, your position is selfish.”

People often ask: **“Do I have a ‘second half’ that is created especially for me? And if so, how do I find it?”**

Yes, a second half exists.

Take one stone in one hand. Now take another stone in the other hand. Do their surfaces match? Do they fit perfectly? No. It is the same with people—their material nature never fully coincides, and the false ego is like a stone with a unique surface.

What is to be done?

Very simple: you take these two stones and, with sparks and grinding, you **rub them against each other** until they become smooth and pleasant, like pebbles. **That is how you obtain your “other half.”**

In the age of Kali, to search for a life companion for a cozy, calm, and happy life is a **great illusion and a very harmful stereotype**. The age of Kali is an age of enmity and fierce struggle. Now it is not easy to build worldly happiness—better not even to think about it.

An enormous amount of bad karma has accumulated in the world, and the number of human sins continues to grow at tremendous speed. Under such conditions, it is impossible to build an ideal society, varṇāśrama-dharma. The world is not ready.

**The mission of our time** is the mass and rapid spread of spiritual knowledge, in order to deprive Kali of his confidence and force him to retreat. All the sins accumulated by humanity make themselves felt every day. Many disasters and untimely deaths can no longer be avoided. The global scale of violence has exceeded the “achievements” of world wars, although it is believed that we live in times of peace.

When people go to war, they do not think about their personal family happiness or a long, calm life. They risk their lives at every step—and thus they come to know real friendship and love.

**In a certain sense, we too are at war**—brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, sannyāsīs, men and women. And our weapon is knowledge. The enemy is ignorance and darkness in our hearts and in people.

Our duty now, since the weapon has been given and positions have been set, is to wage this war correctly. In this war, both the victor who defeats ignorance and the defeated one who is broken by knowledge receive the same result—**spiritual rejuvenation**.

Only one loses: the one who withdraws from the battle for Absolute Truth, wishing to remain in darkness.

One must **kill ignorance and sin without touching the person himself**. Those who do not accept defeat from great knowledge will, unfortunately, accept defeat from ignorance and perish in the depths of Kali-yuga.

Thus, in extreme conditions, family life does not free us from the mission of spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness—on the contrary, it **obliges us to it**, at least for the sake of saving the family itself. Then within the family there will be strong peace, an unbreakable union, created for the struggle against the darkness of Kali-yuga.

**On the hunt one may be a lion, but at home one must be a lamb.**

Usually, when thinking about family happiness, people try to find an ideal partner who would correspond to the descriptions of the śāstras. But in reality, people marry not because they are already pure devotees, but because **they must become such**. And if they are ready to help each other in this, then this is the best family couple.

In fact, **any person who helps us in spiritual life belongs to our spiritual family**. By helping another, we ourselves progress. Thus, by caring for the welfare of others, we automatically care for ourselves as well.

That is exactly why a partner is needed—the result of caring for whom will be the creation of a good family.

By caring for her husband, the wife will not allow him to sink into the swamp of family attachments, but will inspire him to develop detachment and attachment to Kṛṣṇa. **This is the heroism of a woman.**

And the husband, by caring for his wife, will give her good children and will take care of the material and spiritual future of his spouse. **This is the sacrifice of a man.**

Thus, any good family is the result of **mutual care**.

Untrained people also show care, but since they do it in ignorance and know nothing about real benefit, this does not help them much to improve life. I have seen a grandmother, caring for her grandson, buy him a bottle of vodka for his coming of age. A father gave his son a hunting rifle. A mother explained to her daughter how to avoid pregnancy. A husband, caring for his wife, indulged all her whims.

This is also a kind of “care,” and people even feel gratitude in response. But in reality, **such care comes from Kali-yuga, not from Kṛṣṇa**. And no matter how much we thank Kali for his “care” and serve him in return, the result will be disastrous.

**Therefore, it is so important to find a true and truthful companion in life.**


## **A Family Cannot Be Destroyed from the Outside**

> “Marriage is an avalanche which a young man and a young woman bring down on their own heads by reaching for a flower.”
> — George Bernard Shaw

> “It is easy to make friends, but extremely difficult to maintain friendship. The instability of the mind can destroy friendship, finding the most ridiculous pretext.”
> — Rāmāyaṇa

A family can be destroyed **only from within**. Every person has his own limit of self-sacrifice or self-giving. Having reached this line, the spouses stand before a choice: either to part, or to **build the relationship anew**.

> *Psychologist’s Note:*

This is how **crisis** enters a family. In family life this phenomenon is normal—there is not a single family in the world that has managed to avoid crisis periods. The word “crisis” comes from Greek and means “judgment.” Let us think: what is a judgment? It is a process as a result of which it becomes clear **where a person was right and where not**.

In the same way, a family crisis helps to understand that the strategy chosen by the spouses at the present moment **no longer works as before**, and now it must be changed. And, as a rule, **both must change**.

Why are we so afraid of and dislike crises? Simply because we would rather change the entire world than change ourselves.

There are many kinds of crises in relationships. Some are caused by everyday бытовые issues, others by different views on how to raise children, how to relate to the outside world, how to move correctly toward the goal, etc. But separately one must speak about **a religious crisis**, which touches the deepest value system—and therefore this crisis is one of the most painful.

Such a crisis is especially evident in families where one of the members suddenly becomes **a hundred-percent devotee of Kṛṣṇa**. His “irresponsible” devotion shocks relatives so much that sometimes it seriously seems to them that their dear husband (wife, son, daughter…) has gone mad. After all, he is ready for Kṛṣṇa to sacrifice the dearest things we have—family, work, friends.

Sometimes full surrender to God is premature, and therefore brings anxiety to a society of people accustomed to a measured, calm, “like everyone else” life. If someone suddenly begins to serve guru and Kṛṣṇa, completely neglecting place, time, and circumstances, and moreover demanding nothing in return, this will cause natural alarm—because for people this means a **complete break of relationships**. Neither friends nor relatives will be able to understand why he no longer respects them, and sometimes it seems to them that he even hates them. Therefore relatives may sometimes think: **better you had died**.

When preaching comes from hostility, hatred, or pride, it can attract only the intellect—but such preaching will repel the soul. In the end the person will say: “You are saying everything correctly, but I do not agree with you.” But the response to preaching that does not wound the soul will be different: “I still don’t understand much, but I like what you are saying.”

Therefore one must preach to one’s own husband or wife **without destroying marital relations**. They must be preserved, and gradually, carefully, one must try to spiritualize them. Thus, if one adds Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the good sides of the relationship, the bad qualities will imperceptibly be displaced by themselves.

Often one hears one of the spouses complain: “I accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but my husband (or wife) rejects it because he considers himself an Orthodox Christian.” But the matter here is not in religious differences—it is in **different lifestyles**. People often hide behind religion, philosophy, morality, and science simply to satisfy their desires. Therefore there are so many religions, sciences, and political parties that serve people’s selfish desires, and they are irreconcilable with each other.

For example, some people are attached to meat, others want to be vegetarians; some are inclined to drink vodka, others want to renounce this intoxication. In such a case it is clear that different people will choose different religions that allow them to live as they want.

Therefore, **mere belonging to a religion does not resolve family conflicts**. The conflict is resolved by the **common goal of all religions**. Ahimsa (nonviolence) and love of God are the highest principles of all religions, meant to unite all people into God’s family.

Thus, if in one family a conflict arises on religious grounds, it is not difficult to resolve it: **one must accept the authority of the one whose lifestyle is purer**, while remaining faithful to one’s own religion. The criterion of submission is **inner and outer purity**.

Outer purity is regular bathing, clean clothes, bodily hygiene. Inner purity is a clean, positive mind. They are interconnected. Outer purity should serve and support inner purity—purity of thought and heart. Therefore, the purer the lifestyle, the greater the opportunity to elevate the mind and soul.

But a person whose standards are lower **must not be humiliated for this**, because in all sacred scriptures different people are given different standards of purity. However, the higher standards should be respected more.

---

A materialistic person is ready for sacrifice **only under certain conditions**, just as anyone can work hard all his life on condition of good pay. In family life this principle of benefit cannot be applied fully. Or, more precisely, it works only **up to a certain moment**, and then a crisis comes.

For example, a young man and woman in love enjoy communication, not noticing time in their happiness. Then the woman becomes pregnant, and the young man feels that he has gone too far—soon he will have to take upon himself the burden of fatherhood. But he is still young and not ready to sacrifice his freedom.

A crisis comes, accompanied by disappointment and severe pain. Their breakup is accompanied by insulting phrases in self-justification, like saying that she herself wanted it. And in addition to everything, he may offer her only a little money in return.

Another couple may easily overcome this obstacle. But then they are awaited by the next trial—**time**. Are they ready for a long time, supporting the family and raising children, to cooperate with each other, often having different opinions and different characters? How long can they yield to each other? How long can they value each other?

The same thing every day becomes tiresome. When home life and work seem meaningless, when they are unable to bring novelty, freshness, and freedom, this is a very serious test. People who do not pass this crisis sink to the bottom of life.

When family relations become lifelong, boring routine, a person can go mad from monotony. People dream of big money, think about revolutions, become drug addicts or alcoholics, begin a “new life” in computers, gambling, take revenge on each other, or declare war, or entertain themselves by senseless risk. And all this only because they cannot break out of the cursed routine of petty life.

Someone may survive even this, but now before us are only the “remains” of the hero. The snow-white swan with clipped wings has become dirty and ugly in captivity. And the former hero, resigned to routine and thinking, “Let the children live fully for me now,” is awaited by a real family knockout—**love for another person**.

Then events usually develop according to the same scheme: the wife creates an unbearable atmosphere at home. Hysterics, reproaches, insults, hatred—and as a result the husband in love runs away without looking back to his new dream.

We have described various difficult moments of family life. In each of them there was the same defect—**the absence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness**. In spiritual practice we face exactly the same serious problems—but we solve them differently. Our goal is not simply to survive at any cost, but also **to remain a human being in the full sense of the word**, without losing honor and dignity.

Passing the first test, devotees enter one or another āśrama fearlessly and with full responsibility. In gṛhastha-āśrama devotees are ready to accept **any child sent by destiny from above**.

As for the second test—there can be no talk of routine or boredom in any āśrama where there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

> “However, for Emperor Manu life did not lose its charm; he grew old, but his life, as in former years, retained freshness and novelty because it passed in an atmosphere of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For a person who possesses Kṛṣṇa consciousness, life never loses the charm of novelty.”
> — Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.22.35, Purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda

The third test is the most difficult. But devotees of Viṣṇu, encountering **kāma**—agitation, attraction, infatuation—have sufficient spiritual experience to overcome these obstacles **together**. This is the secret of successful family life.

They conquer kāma by **mutual respect, sacrifice, and gratitude** to each other. In a family one can forgive any mistakes **except ingratitude for sacrifice and fulfillment of duty**.

> “A cow-killer, a drunkard, a thief, or one who breaks his vow may be forgiven—but there is no forgiveness for the ungrateful.”
> — Rāmāyaṇa

The highest form of gratitude is **smaraṇam**—the ability to remember spiritual help. The duty of spouses is to support this remembrance, always discussing their shared spiritual path. Because this is exactly the experience they must pass on through the chain of family succession to their descendants.

Moreover, they personally **owe each other their achievements** that each has at the present moment. Another man or woman may attract our feelings—but a husband or wife will always remind us of the **higher duty**. This is how kāma is overcome.

Another form of gratitude is remembering **material and emotional help**. This is difficult, because on the material level we always make many mistakes, which can nullify good relations—and even the memory of them. To prevent this, mistakes must be **admitted and then corrected**. Such behavior undoubtedly increases gratitude to each other and strengthens the family.

> *Psychologist’s Note:*

The ability to show gratitude is one of the **abilities to love**. Many people were not taught this in their families. Even worse is when there is painful experience of showing gratitude in the past, which erased this ability from life as something that causes pain.

Gratitude can be expressed by a word, a look, a touch—it is only important to learn to be attentive to what is valuable for your partner. Try to do this tactfully and in time.

Saying warm words is also a separate skill. For example, to say: “You made a tasty soup” is a compliment addressed to ability. But to say: “You are so good, and your soup is wonderful” is a compliment addressed to the person—it is much more weighty.

The word “compliment” itself means “to add.” When you add something to your loved one with words or a look, inside them energetically there becomes more space; stiffness and tension go away, freedom appears, and a desire to respond in kind arises.

And on the contrary, when help or an action goes unnoticed, a person closes up, withdraws into himself; as a result, constriction, resentment, and pain appear.

**We are learning to love—and therefore it is very important to learn to be grateful.**


## **The Twists of Fate**

> “My wife, with whom we have four children (the eldest is now eighteen, the youngest nine), left me on the advice of a priest. She wants to deprive me of parental rights, take all the property and the apartment, because in her eyes I am not religious enough. She considers the priest a man of God, almost a prophet. They are both actively acting against me. I always thought my wife was a very good person and could not understand the reason for such a страшная и sudden change. In the end, I was advised to consult astrologers. And the astrologer said that in a previous life my wife and the priest were lovers whom I killed. Now in this life they are taking revenge on me…”
> *(From correspondence)*

All people without exception—even the great conquerors of the world—are only **toys in the hands of fate**. Karma, although temporary, is practically insurmountable. This means that none of the events of life will pass without a trace, whether good or bad. But the difficulty is that a person **creates new karma**.

To finally overcome karma accumulated over many lives, one must learn to **endure its consequences without creating new karma**, acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But even if we are well armed with knowledge and rely on Kṛṣṇa in everything, our life can still be unpredictable because of actions performed in the past.

Therefore even devotees under Kṛṣṇa’s protection are sometimes presented with surprises by life. Someone becomes our follower, someone criticizes us; someone interferes in our personal life, someone remains indifferent; someone wants to cooperate with us, someone refuses. In the family, someone may suddenly fall ill; children may be born disobedient; there may be catastrophically not enough money to live, or for someone more than enough; in some things husband and wife understand each other, in others they do not.

> mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya
> śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ
> āgamāpāyino ’nityās
> tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata
> “O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress and their disappearance in due course are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 2.14*

All karmic events of our life can be passed either **through the senses and the mind**, or **through transcendental knowledge**. Family life we usually experience on the level of senses and mind. That is why it seems so difficult and sometimes unbearable. But if we add transcendental knowledge to it, then we can become truly intelligent and patient even toward severe shocks, such as the loss of relatives or property.

No matter how bad the karma that offers us enemies, ill-wishers, mistresses, and various forms of deception during life may be, we can emerge from any situation **with dignity** thanks to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Because Kṛṣṇa consciousness gives us **great freedom of choice**.

At a festive banquet we may be offered forty dishes, but that does not mean we must eat everything. We can always choose what is useful and necessary for us at the moment. In the same way, bad karma, offering us disgusting circumstances, provokes us to continue doing bad deeds. But the spiritual master will tell us: “Listen to your heart and serve Kṛṣṇa, without paying attention to events.” Having made the right choice, we will see that karma gradually recedes and only devotional service remains: association with devotees, taste for the Holy Name, and compassion for innocent people.

It often happens that **married men or women suddenly fall in love with someone else**. This feeling lasts on average about two years and can be very dangerous for their family, spiritual life, and work. Under the influence of infatuation, interest in everything else weakens, and a person can behave exactly like one possessed, confidently committing destructive acts without caring about consequences. When he later realizes that it was only māyā, illusion, it is often already too late.

Modern psychologists distinguish true love from infatuation by three signs.

> *Psychologist’s Note:*

**First**, infatuation does not involve either will or conscious decision. No matter how much you may want to fall in love, you cannot force yourself to do so. On the other hand, you may not want it at all, but suddenly these feelings come over you and take possession of you. Often people fall in love at the wrong time—and sometimes with people they do not even like.

**Second**, infatuation is not love, because it does not require any effort. Everything we do in a state of infatuation requires no discipline or conscious effort. Long expensive phone calls, money spent on trips to see each other, gifts often costing more than you can afford, work you do—all this means nothing to you. Just as a bird instinctively builds a nest, we instinctively do unusual, sometimes uncharacteristic things for each other.

**Third**, a person in love is not interested in stimulating or even supporting the personal growth and development of the other. Infatuation does not focus on our growth or the growth of the other person. Moreover, it gives us the feeling that we have already reached everything we need and do not need further development. We are at the peak of happiness and want only to remain there. We are sure our beloved does not need to become better, because they are already perfect—we only hope they will remain so.


What is untimely infatuation? It is **illusory external energy testing our spiritual intelligence**. Materialists seek such illusory “love,” for which they are ready to sacrifice almost anything, just to be happy for a short time. The trouble is that infatuation in mature years **does not cooperate** with our family, our work, or our environment.

Devotees of Kṛṣṇa may also pass through this test. But if their intelligence has truly taken shelter in Kṛṣṇa, they will remain pure. Without breaking the fourth regulative principle (no illicit sex), they pass this test easily, because Kṛṣṇa gives the necessary intelligence:

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te


> “To those who constantly serve Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 10.10*

But if the principles of purity are violated and an illicit sexual relationship arises, then the consequences can be **very severe**, because having stepped onto the path of lust, a person **loses his intelligence and falls**. However, gradually, after becoming disillusioned with what he has done, he may again turn to God and continue his forgotten path.

> “When the husband is disturbed, the whole family is destroyed, the children scatter, the enterprise collapses—nothing remains untouched. Therefore, a woman who strives to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should live peacefully with her husband, and husband and wife should not separate under any circumstances. Husband and wife must restrain their sexual desire and focus their minds on Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that their lives may be successful. After all, in the material world a man needs a woman, and a woman needs a man. When they come together, they should live peacefully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not darting about like lightning flashing from one cloud to another.”
> — *The Source of Eternal Pleasure. Description of Autumn*

Husband and wife must live together, not remain separated for long, and **never part**. Someone may ask: “What if we have become tired of each other to the point of death?” We answer that this is **natural and normal**. One can become tired only of the **material side** of marital relationships, but never of the **spiritual** side.

When a person becomes tired of everything in this world, it means he has acquired **complete experience of material existence**. Only after that can he truly become interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sooner or later spouses will exhaust their material relationship, and then it will be easy for them to remain constantly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such relationships can be called **perfect**.

Most often spouses become tired of each other when they become **too attached** to one another. Attachment binds and restricts freedom of communication, and therefore husband or wife regularly wants to run away from home to friends. Thus arise “secret suppers,” bohemian gatherings, hobby clubs. Often the husband has one taste in social life, and the wife has quite another, and therefore they do not develop a common activity and a common culture in the home.

But it is **very important** for spouses to become jointly absorbed in **one shared activity**, in addition to their ordinary family duties. The best thing is to **regularly invite guests** and spend time in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness: songs and dances, kīrtanas and bhajanas, children’s theater and home feasts, philosophical discussions and debates, guru-kathā and festivals.

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura writes in his *Dalalera Gīta* that Lord Nityānanda opened the **marketplace of the Holy Name**. He sells the Holy Name without demanding anything in return, yet He bargains very eagerly. Seeing a person’s faith, He immediately gives the greatest ecstasy. **Faith is the only price**—for the rich and the poor, for people of different origin and knowledge. Any person can acquire spiritual taste by chanting the Holy Name with faith.

> “Now, having escaped from the trap of māyā, you may either remain a family man or be a sannyāsī living in the forest—it does not matter, for you will no longer experience any anxiety. There is nothing more to fear from the age of Kali. The merciful Lord Nityānanda distributes the Holy Name even to the caṇḍālas.”

Without any special effort, in the course of such a lively and joyful life, a **large circle of real friends and well-wishers** forms around one family. As we see, on a spiritual foundation the family can grow **without limit**. We have so many brothers and sisters in God and friends of Kṛṣṇa—but we have them only **as long as we possess the necessary “commodity” for them**, which is the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. As soon as the chanting stops in the home, the “customers” will begin to leave one by one.

Without Kṛṣṇa we will not have a large family, and in a small family we will begin to **suffocate and suffer, as if in captivity**.

A devotee gṛhastha who has not yet reached a certain level of love for God **should not isolate himself** from the society of devotees. Otherwise he will either turn into a dry, insensitive ascetic, or, on the contrary, he may sink into watching karmic movies, become a television addict, or something similar. **Our motto is: to be together!**

As soon as a devotee falls into isolation, he **quickly weakens**, and his spiritual life comes into danger. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that one stick can easily be broken, but a **bundle of sticks** cannot be broken. Gṛhasthas must be conscious of their **spiritual bond** with one another and with the society of devotees.


## Unhappiness

> na lolupāyāpi deśe
> na gṛhārūḍha-cetase
> nābhaktāya ca me jñātu
> na mad-bhakta-dviṣām api

> “This should not be explained to those who are greedy, or too attached to household life, nor to one who is not devoted to Me, nor to one who is envious of My devotees or of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

**Commentary.** Those who strive to cause harm to other living beings are **not capable of understanding** the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For such people the entrance to the kingdom of loving, transcendental service to the Lord is closed.

There are also such “disciples” who display **artificial humility** before the spiritual master, but in reality perform service pursuing some **selfish goals**. They will also never be able to understand what Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service truly are.

The philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is likewise inaccessible to those who, having taken initiation in another religious tradition, do not understand that **devotional service is the universal foundation** of all methods of realizing the Supreme Personality of God. There were cases when young people joined our Movement but, having been raised in the traditions of another faith, soon left and became lost in the wilderness of material life.

In fact, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is **not a sectarian religion**. It is a practical process by which one can understand the Supreme Lord and one’s relationship with Him. Anyone can join our Movement by casting aside religious prejudices. But unfortunately, there are people who think otherwise, and **to such people one should not explain** the principles of the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Materialistic people, as a rule, are driven by the desire to **make a name for themselves**, to become famous and to achieve material prosperity. And if such a person turns to Kṛṣṇa consciousness hoping to reach these goals, he also will **never be able to understand** transcendental philosophy.

Such people follow religious principles only in order to appear virtuous and God-fearing in society. They join one or another religious organization caring only about their **prestige**. This is especially common in our age. Such people will also never understand the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Even if a person does not seek material acquisitions, but is **too attached to family life**, he also will not be able to understand the meaning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. At first glance it may seem that such people are not very eager for material benefits, but they are obstructed by **strong attachment to wife, children, and family well-being**.

And finally, a person who does not have any of the above faults, but nevertheless **has no interest in serving the Supreme Personality of God**—in other words, a non-devotee—also cannot understand the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

— *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.32.40*


When **one of the family members** departs from the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and abandons spiritual practice, **this is a great misfortune**.

It is very painful to see how māyā gradually takes a person away and carries him back to his old sinful habits, depriving him of elevated thoughts and feelings. Figuratively speaking, she simply **cuts off his head before our eyes**.

There are people who practiced Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but were **not truly devoted to God**. They came in order to fulfill material desires which they had failed to realize in ordinary material life.

For example, they may think that Kṛṣṇa consciousness will help them change the political system in the country or finally give them an opportunity to live in a decent society. Perhaps they wanted to become famous for their strict ascetic practice or for fiery preaching. Maybe they were attracted by mystical siddhis.

The position of people with such motives is **very unstable**, because when they do not receive recognition and support for their materialistic views, they begin to **criticize spiritual people**, as a result of which they lose their taste for the Holy Name. Then old habits and tastes return. In this, perhaps, there is no great tragedy, because **there was not yet a real connection with God**.

Other people are **true devotees of Kṛṣṇa**, who sincerely wish to dedicate themselves to pure devotional service, but who have **made mistakes**. Either they offended other devotees in a struggle for power or superiority, or they were punished for bad behavior in the society of Vaiṣṇavas.

Such devotees fall **only externally**, but their **heart remains with Kṛṣṇa**. Kṛṣṇa speaks about this in the Bhagavad-gītā:

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ
> “Even if a person commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in exclusive devotional service to Me, he should be considered saintly, for he is properly situated.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 9.30*

It is **very difficult to distinguish** a devotee from a non-devotee. Great demons are, in fact, sometimes **great devotees**. In the age of Kali, divine and demoniac qualities exist **within one and the same person**, and they struggle with each other. At one moment it seems that a person is a demon, and at another moment we see that he is a devotee.

The uttama-adhikārī sees **all living beings as devotees**, and therefore commits no offenses. But we must be **very careful in our judgments and conclusions**, because who is to be a devotee of Kṛṣṇa and who is not is, in the final analysis, **decided by Kṛṣṇa Himself**.


So, if such a misfortune happens in a family with one of its members, the **first thing to understand** is that **Kṛṣṇa is giving us a lesson**. He is the original guru and wants to teach us something higher.

As soon as we tune our mind **positively toward Kṛṣṇa**, it becomes easy to see our own mistakes, easy to repent, and easy to begin spiritual life anew.

But if the mind **cannot be tuned positively toward Kṛṣṇa**, then there is another chance, which many people resort to in such a situation: to think not of Kṛṣṇa personally, but of His **aspects**, for example, of the Absolute Truth. The impersonal aspect helps one avoid conflict with God, and the mind becomes calm.

If a person wants to **forget Kṛṣṇa**, the material world exists for that purpose. But if a person has received initiation from a **genuine spiritual master**, this will not be so easy—especially if he lives in a family of devotees.

Devotee relatives should **continue their service and their practice** even in such a difficult time for the family, because the **prayers and devotional service** of close ones will help the fallen person **to recover**.


## Death and Divorce

> na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin
> nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ
> ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo
> na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre
> “For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 2.20*

Another misfortune that awaits each of us is **death**, which comes unexpectedly, whenever it sees fit. Very rarely does it happen that husband and wife die on the same day. The purpose of death is **to separate people and to take away everything they have**, because no one owns anything here.

Death is extremely merciless: it separates even the closest and dearest relatives who wished to always be together. Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā that **birth, old age, disease, and death are evils** from which a person must be freed. One can conquer death by realizing the eternal soul, but until then, close people may experience the full weight of losing one another.

Death that brings grief can be **natural**, **sudden**, or **tragic**. But **heroic death** and **death in a state of yoga** do not cause sorrow or fear; rather, they inspire and fill people with admiration. Such deaths are glorified in the Vedas.

> “Sūta Gosvāmī said: Thus Bhīṣmadeva, merging himself in the Supersoul, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with his mind, speech, sight, and actions, became silent, and his breathing stopped.”
> **Commentary.** The stage which Bhīṣmadeva achieved while leaving his material body is called **nirvikalpa-samādhi**, because he absorbed his mind in the remembrance of the Lord and in meditation on His pastimes. He glorified the Lord, and the Lord personally appeared before his eyes. Thus all his activities became completely concentrated on the Lord. This is the highest stage of perfection, and anyone who practices devotional service can reach this stage.
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.9.43*

> “Then both men and demigods beat drums in his honor, and noble kings offered him respects and obeisances, and flowers rained down from the sky.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.9.45*

**Natural death** comes from old age, when it is already clear to everyone that a person’s time has come, because life has become burdensome both for him and for others. He is seen off with tears of loss, remembering his good deeds, but also with a certain feeling of relief.

**Sudden death** is unexpected, like a lightning strike. A person could have lived and done much good; his life, one might say, was only beginning—and suddenly he is gone. People grieve deeply, thinking about the injustice of life.

**Tragic death** is when an innocent person dies because of someone’s fault or mistake, or out of grief for a beloved person. Such a death can deeply shock those who were its immediate cause, leaving an indelible feeling of guilt.

Any of these deaths is accompanied by a sense of fear, sorrow, and the inevitability of one’s own fate, because this is **death in ignorance**. But in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, death brings **rich spiritual realizations** and inspires people to live better, strengthening faith and aspiration for God. In the Bhagavad-gītā, Kṛṣṇa says that a wise person does not lament either for the living or for the dead. One does not lament heroes and great saints—**one worships them**.

Grandfather Bhīṣma was both a great heroic warrior and a great saint. His departure, described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, evokes admiration. By his deeds and purity of thought, he inspires people to this day to follow the path of duty, even at the cost of life.

If a relative dies in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we will not feel destructive grief and fear. We will feel the **transcendental presence of Kṛṣṇa** and experience the feeling of impending separation, knowing that he is now with God.

> “The Personality of Godhead, who appears in the mind of the devotee through concentrated devotional service, meditation, and chanting of the Holy Name, liberates him from the bondage of karmic activity at the moment he quits the material body.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.9.23*

By being present at the departure of a devotee, we receive **great spiritual benefit** and hope that after death he will care for us. For example, when Dhruva Mahārāja was leaving for Vaikuṇṭha, he remembered his mother and waited until she also joined him.

If relatives feel unbearable pain of loss, **properly performed funeral rites** completely remove heavy thoughts and grief.


**Divorce** for a family is the **disintegration of relationships**, similar to death. Former husband and wife, as it were, “die” for each other, because they cannot or do not want to fulfill marital duties. People who have no duties in this world are like the dead. For example, in the life of vagrants and homeless people there are no duties either to family or to society; therefore successful people look at them as at the dead. **Marriage is animated by duties.**

There is **“natural” divorce**, when happy relations are completely exhausted: there are no children, no common goal, no money, and the spouses no longer see any meaning in continuing a completely extinguished relationship.

There is **premature divorce**. It seemed they could live on, there was much in common between them and even some love, but suddenly adultery, like a deadly disease, destroyed everything in a single moment.

There is **tragic divorce**, when people are attached to each other but cannot live together because they seem an unsuitable couple to others—for example, to hostile relatives.

All these stories are sad and resemble **death in ignorance**, because Kṛṣṇa consciousness is absent in them.

But there is also **“heroic” divorce**, when spouses together dedicate themselves to a mission, and they have no time left for full family life. As the song says: *“He was ordered to go west, she—to the other side…”* They are happy in their sacrifice and renunciation of worldly affairs.

And **complete external separation** of spouses happens when the husband accepts **sannyāsa**. He leaves not in order to acquire another wife, but **breaks relations with women altogether** in order to fully, without remainder, immerse himself in devotional service and preaching all over the world.

Sannyāsa is the **best “divorce”**, which has no defects. It is considered that a sannyāsī has already fulfilled all his debts to human society and the demigods. Now he is freed from all civil obligations; he may live anywhere, but have no fixed residence, and speak only about God and think of Him twenty-four hours a day.

The former wife of the sannyāsī meditates on his renunciation, worshiping his sandals, and drawing inspiration from this, continues to serve God, remaining under the care of her grown children. If for some reason the children cannot care for her, or if there are no children at all, she may go to live in a temple to directly serve the Deities or perform any other service, living without attachments. Thus she **shares her husband’s renunciation**, but as a woman she always remains **under protection**.


Thus we see that **divorce of spouses is, in a certain sense, a natural thing**, at least because this world itself is temporary.

The **best means** for spouses to avoid the suffering that inevitably awaits each of them is to **develop detachment before new material desires arise or before death comes**.

Therefore, family life that **does not contribute to the development of detachment** can conceal within itself **great danger**.


## The Dangers of Family Life

> “Then King Purañjana began to think of how he had lived with his wife. He remembered that she never sat down to eat until he had eaten, never took her bath until he had finished bathing, that she was always very attached to him, and therefore, when he sometimes became angry and scolded her, she would simply remain silent, tolerating all his unjust reproaches.”
> **Commentary.** A wife should always be obedient to her husband. If a wife possesses such qualities as obedience, gentleness, and readiness to serve her husband, he will always be attentive to her. A husband’s attachment to his wife makes family life easier, but **complicates spiritual advancement**. Therefore it is so necessary that Kṛṣṇa consciousness be established in every home. If husband and wife are attached to each other in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, both benefit, because the center of their existence is Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, a man who is too attached to his wife becomes a woman in the next life, and a woman who is attached to her husband becomes a man in the next life.
> Certainly, for a woman to be born a man is a great benefit, but this is not so for a man who becomes a woman.
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 4.28.19*

If husband and wife are very happy living together, **another danger appears**: they may become attached to **their personal happiness** and forget about **spiritual progress**, which looks like a difficult road through impassable, rocky mountains.

“Why such difficulties?” they think. “The main thing is that we ourselves are happy. What we have achieved must be preserved and protected. Everything else can come later.”

Thus, desiring **stability and security** for their family, devotees may stop “taking risks” — they stop dedicating their life to preaching, stop going on saṅkīrtana. They want a **“reliable” existence**.

Such is the power of illusion.

As soon as a person has an obedient wife, a good house, and money, he feels himself **completely safe**:

> “I eat what I want, sleep on a good bed, I have a car and money, everyone obeys me — I control everything. It is not like before, when I was preaching and going on saṅkīrtana — no material guarantees and full control by leaders. Now I am my own master, and Kṛṣṇa is in my heart and helps me in all my affairs.”

> “King Purañjana was very much attached to family life and to the conception of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. His attraction for his wife was practically his ruin. When the time came for them to separate, his lamentation knew no bounds.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 4.28.17*

It is **not easy** to get out of such an illusion. Sometimes **only great misfortunes** can sober a person who has forgotten **what a cruel world he actually lives in**.

The illusion of happiness and well-being is **actively supported by the entire materialistic society**. Any householder, earning his livelihood, is forced to come into contact with it.

Moreover, **agents of māyā are now in every home**, and they possess tremendous power to enslave the human mind.

These are **multi-channel high-quality televisions**, which have paralyzed the minds of millions of people, focusing them exclusively on sense enjoyment and various forms of violence.

It is **far better** to have philosophical disagreements, to quarrel with devotees, to argue with one’s wife — but **remain in the real world** — than to become a hundred-percent devotee of the television, having lost understanding and interest in real life, which is irreversibly flowing right before our eyes.

The real problem is that the television is a **dead box** through which an immeasurable amount of audio-visual information is passed day and night.

* You **cannot** enter into dialogue with it.
* You **cannot** argue with it.
* You **cannot** express your understanding in response.

Television **only asserts “truths”** with which it is impossible to live and communicate.

Moreover, in this flow of events and opinions, **your individuality dissolves**, consciousness becomes clouded, a person becomes **principle-less and weak-willed**, and accepts everything that is given to him **like a domestic dog**.

Break away from the voices of the **“sirens”**. Remember that the real hero of your life **is you yourself**.

Your true path is **to live and to conquer**. Begin it with victory **over your own senses**.

Dear wives — drive your gourmet husbands, your TV-addicted husbands, your husbands offended at the whole world or thinking themselves already perfect — **drive them out to saṅkīrtana at least sometimes**.

Let them tell people about **the eternity of the soul** and about **Kṛṣṇa**, who loves heroes and **personally protects** such devotees who take risks for Him.

Kṛṣṇa **does not love television**, because in it the already distorted world is distorted many times more — and this world will **never** be transformed that way.

**We must be transformed.**

Then Guru and Kṛṣṇa will be pleased — and **only then** will we be truly happy.


## Support Faith in One Another

> “Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.
> …Thus faith is the most important factor in progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* it is said that faith is firm conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa one can achieve all perfection. This is called real faith…”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 9.2*

The **type of family** is nothing but the **type of faith**.

The food people eat, the books they read, the friends they associate with — all of this indicates **the type of their faith**.

If we want to **elevate our faith**, then we must:

* eat **purer food**,
* read **more elevated books**,
* associate with **more elevated people**.

This is the **criterion for the development of faith**.

The development of faith is accompanied by the development of **purity** and an increase of **happiness**, therefore the process of developing faith is **very joyful for the whole family**.

There can be **no happiness in faithlessness**.

Faithlessness is faith in something that **does not actually lead to purity or knowledge**.

A husband and wife living without faith in the Supreme Lord are **just two helpless straws in the ocean waves of time**. How can they help one another? How can they guarantee safety and happiness, when they are under the power of **merciless time**?

The higher a devotee rises in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the **more careful** he must be.

The greater the height, the **more dangerous the fall**.

As long as we are under the influence of **kāma** (lust), it can, like the force of gravity, **pull us down at any moment**. Even if the height seems enormous and unattainable to many, the **possibility of falling remains** until we reach the realm where the power of kāma does not extend.

At high levels, kāma manifests in a **refined, subtle way** — as high culture of behavior and thought, as the ability to appreciate the beautiful and the intelligent.

For those who have reached great heights in spiritual life, the *Bhagavad-gītā* gives the appropriate instruction:

> brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino ’rjuna
> mām upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate
> “From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains My abode, O son of Kuntī, never takes birth again.”
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 8.16*

Śrīla Prabhupāda sometimes admires the beauty of a rose, seeing how wonderful Kṛṣṇa’s creation is, and sometimes compares this world to a **garbage pit**.

Transcendentalists sometimes admire the beauty and intelligence of man, and sometimes say that a beautiful woman is no better than a lump of stool, and the intelligence of a materialist is no better than the intelligence of a pig.

Kṛṣṇa Himself states in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam*:

> “O respectable sages and venerable kings, please know from Me that a person who accepts this material body made of mucus, bile, and air as his self; who considers his family and relatives to be his own; who thinks that material objects are worshipable; or who goes to a holy place merely to bathe, but never associates with great souls, sages, or mahātmās — such a person, even in a human body, is nothing but an animal, like a donkey.”

Family people should **not be disturbed** by such apparently contradictory statements, because here it is **not a rejection of the material**, but a question of **the correct attitude toward it**.

As soon as a person develops a sense of **ownership** toward his body and the bodies of his relatives, and also toward the land where he was born, he becomes **like a donkey or a cow**.

It is very important to hear such **direct instructions** in the family, especially in families of advanced devotees.

The result will be **unexpected** — relationships between relatives will become **better and purer**.

Such an honest family **cannot be an obstacle** to spiritual advancement.

If, however, someone feels unpleasant hearing such instructions and is still attracted to elevated sentimentalism, then he should **tolerate it** and, out of respect for the Vedas, **simply accept it on faith**.

By **maintaining faith in the scriptures**, we make our own future and the future of our family **much easier**.


## To Men

> “An intelligent person should act very simply in this world. When his friends, children, parents, brothers, or anyone else give him advice, he should outwardly agree with them — ‘yes, fine’ — but inwardly he should be firmly resolved not to burden his life with unnecessary troubles that will hinder him in attaining the highest goal.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.14.6*

> “Dogs, fallen persons, outcastes, including caṇḍālas, must be provided with all necessities, and it is the duty of the gṛhasthas to do so. In order to properly receive guests and generally take care of people, a gṛhastha should be ready to give up even his attachment to his wife.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.14.11*

Since a man brings **material wealth** into the home, he must know the **means of liberation from greed**.

The medicine for greed is **generosity and care for other people**. For this, he must be ready to give up even his attachment to his wife, because greed, in the end, like rust, will little by little **eat away even the protected iron of virtue** and lead to complete poverty.

To become poor, a man must **lose his intelligence**.
To lose intelligence, a man must **commit sins**.
To descend to sin, a man must **lose shame**.
To lose shame, one must become **proud and arrogant**.
To cultivate pride, one must **lose virtue**.
To lose a good attitude toward people, one must become **greedy**.

Therefore, the duty of all breadwinners is **to feed guests and help the needy and the destitute**.

Every person who bears any responsibility for others is a **representative of God** for those under his care, because he must care for and educate them according to the **Supreme will**.

To be a representative of God **does not mean** to act according to one’s own whims and the impulses of uncontrolled senses.

In the age of Kali many **false avatars and “representatives of God”** appear, and all of them, under the banner of their “divinity,” do not follow the injunctions of the Vedas. But in fact this is the **main condition** for all representatives of God: to follow the teaching of the *Bhagavad-gītā*, to walk in the footsteps of the previous ācāryas, and to teach this to others.

A leader is one who can **teach by his own example** how others themselves can become leaders, so that they, in turn, will set an example for the next.

A husband is a **representative of God** for his wife. But this statement must be understood **correctly and cautiously**, because by misunderstanding it a man will inevitably make a mistake and degrade due to **excessive pride**.

He may turn into a **disgusting despot** in the family, constantly demanding sense gratification and exploiting his wife.

A representative of God is **His humble servant**, full of humility and compassion for people. He must think about how to **satisfy the spiritual master**, not his own senses.

To have such a husband or father is a **great blessing from above** for the whole family and for future generations. Moreover, the whole society will become spiritualized by following such a path. God can always be present in relationships between people.

Here is what Śrīla Madhvācārya says about this:

> “A woman should relate to her husband as to the Supreme Lord. Similarly, a disciple should relate to his spiritual master as to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a śūdra should consider the brāhmaṇa the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a servant — his master. Thus all of them will become devotees of the Lord. In other words, by such a way of thinking they will attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”

Although by his nature a man tends to **show off before a woman**, demonstrating his independence and strength, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa should not fall into this trap of **false ego**.

Animals have energy only for four activities: **eating, sleeping, mating, and defending**. But a human being has **excess energy**, which can be properly used only if he possesses knowledge higher than knowledge of bodily needs.

One must remember that the **extra strength and independence** given to man from above are meant **for realizing God**, not for personal glory and boasting.

If a man **subdues his pride** and engages his surplus energy in devotional service, then he will not fall into captivity to the material desires of his family.

But one who is still unable to cope with false ego and wants to remain independent from the representatives of God, by the laws of nature will **serve his relatives**, without understanding how to connect this with Kṛṣṇa.

But *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* says that for an intelligent person this is very simple: when relatives give him advice about how to improve their material well-being, he should **outwardly agree**, but **inwardly be resolute** in fulfilling his spiritual vows and sādhana.

In Kali-yuga, human life is meant for **chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa**. There is no other way.

The devotees of Lord Caitanya found full self-expression in kīrtana.

> “The inhabitants of Navadvīpa decorated their houses with banana trunks, mango leaves, and green coconuts, and placed water pots at the doors. In every house lamps burned with ghee, and on the altars stood trays with yogurt, grains, and durvā grass.
> All this was done as if by some unknown command. Men, women, and children ran out into the streets and could no longer return home. Intoxicated with joy, they followed the chanting crowd, forgetting everything in the world.
> Seeing how carelessly and freely the residents had abandoned their homes, thieves thought to themselves, ‘A good opportunity to rob them,’ but the chanting of the Holy Name, flowing into their ears, purified them of evil intentions and made them join everyone, joyfully repeating the sweet transcendental name of the Lord.”
> — *Caitanya-bhāgavata*

By following this main instruction, gṛhasthas will never forget the **laws of God**, and **peace and harmony** will be maintained in society.

> “It is precisely the gṛhasthas who are meant to see that the laws established by the Supreme Personality of Godhead are strictly observed, and that no conflicts arise between people, nations, and countries.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.14.7*,
> Commentary by Śrīla Prabhupāda

Dear men, please try to **establish in your families the example of attentive and deep chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra**, acquire spiritual taste by associating with elevated devotees in your own home, and become **strong spiritual leaders**.

In this way you will honorably fulfill your **spiritual and material duties**, regardless of the result that awaits us.

## To Women

> “To serve her husband, always wish him well, show equal goodwill toward his relatives and friends, follow the same vows as her husband — these are the four principles that virtuous women must follow.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.11.25*

> “A virtuous woman should dress nicely and wear golden ornaments to please her husband. Always neat and attractive, she should take care of cleanliness and order in the home: sweep the floors and wash everything with water and other cleaning agents. She should take care of household utensils, see that there is always the fragrance of incense and flowers in the house, and be ready to fulfill the wishes of her husband. Modest, truthful, and self-controlled, she should speak to her husband gently and serve him with love, considering time and circumstances.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.11.26–27*

> “A virtuous woman should be free from greed and be satisfied in all circumstances. She should skillfully manage household affairs and know well the laws of religion. She should always be attentive and clean, and her speech should be pleasant and truthful. Thus a virtuous woman should lovingly serve her husband, if he is not fallen.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.11.28*

> “A woman who serves her husband, following in every respect the example of the goddess of fortune, will certainly return home, back to Godhead, and together with her husband, the faithful servant of the Lord, will happily live on the Vaikuṇṭha planets.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.11.29*

In the age of Kali, virtue is **less than is necessary for a happy life**, therefore it is much more difficult for a modern woman to follow such rules of behavior in the family.

**Psychologist’s note:**

It is no secret that today women surpass men in many respects. Day by day there are more intelligent women; they occupy higher and higher positions, becoming wealthy entrepreneurs, deputies, heads of enterprises. Where does this ability come from?

This ability to move toward a goal, to be enduring and active, comes from a woman’s **capacity to fulfill the maternal duty**. A mother fulfills her duty to the child regardless of circumstances. It is precisely the capacity for **self-sacrifice and selfless service** that gives a woman the opportunity to manifest her abilities.

Another question is that, without fully fulfilling her true purpose — her duty toward her husband and children — a woman, even having achieved career heights and financial independence, **still does not become happy**.

For a woman, unlike a man, **career is not the main component of happiness**. The main components are **success in marriage and motherhood**.

An ordinary woman expects compliments and good treatment from her husband. But if she acts unwisely or says foolish things, the husband will become angry, because such is the nature of a man. He has the right to be angry with his wife.

A man in anger is not capable of giving compliments or pleasant words. He speaks sharply and directly. The woman is shocked by such a sudden change: just now he loved her, and now he does not.

“So this is what he really thinks,” she concludes, and, as a rule, remembers it for the rest of her life.

Then the husband has to convince his wife all over again that he loves and values her. But she is no longer as naïve as before, and gradually more and more grievances accumulate in her mind.

In Kali-yuga, grievances usually **overpower everything good**.

In the end, the woman begins to complain about her husband, recalling all the bad things, showing everyone with tears in her eyes how unhappy she is. In such a state she begins to envy other women whose husbands are “better.” She forgets that a woman receives the husband she **deserves**.

Often the mentality of an offended woman, unable to forgive, leads to a **break between the spouses**.

Therefore, it is very difficult for a man to live with a wife who is prone to foolish behavior and does not know how to forgive.

Since it is very difficult to live with one wife for a whole lifetime, the śāstras say that a person should develop **detachment** and in due course free himself from attachment to wife and children — or else not marry at all.

But there is another way: **learn to forgive one another and stop doing foolish things**.

For this, one must intensively develop the qualities of **goodness**.

A **saintly woman** is capable of creating an atmosphere of **Vaikuṇṭha** in the home. If we are not saintly, then at least we can try to follow what is written for us in the scriptures. The result will exceed all expectations.

In our time this is especially important for a spiritual movement such as ISKCON, because only very few will formally be able to accept sannyāsa. The overwhelming majority of devotees bind their lives to their wives, and if women do not make efforts to improve their behavior and qualities, if saintly women do not appear in families, then our society will not be able to develop properly. It will resemble a man trying to swim across a river with **weights tied to his legs**.

The dharma of a woman is described in the Vedas as **the most difficult**, and for her there is **no better means of progress** than serving her husband.

King Yudhiṣṭhira addresses the sage Mārkaṇḍeya:

> “Tell us of the greatness of women devoted to their husbands, of those, O flawless one, who restrain their senses and do not give the heart free rein, worshiping their husband as a god. And it seems to me, O mighty lord, twice-born, that the humility of women before parents and husbands is not given easily. I know nothing more difficult than the severe dharma of a woman.”

But the śāstras warn that a woman is **not obliged to serve a fallen husband**.

A fallen husband is one who does not serve God and has sinful habits. With such a person it is better **not to live together**.

A virtuous woman is not obliged to obey the orders of such a husband. Women should not become slaves of **narādhamas**, the lowest of men.

Although each spouse has his or her duties, a virtuous wife should **not serve a fallen husband**. If the husband is fallen, the woman is advised to **cease association** with him.

However, refusal to associate with the husband does not mean that she should remarry, for that would be **immorality**.

If a virtuous woman, unfortunately, has a fallen husband, then she should **live separately from him**.

> Commentary by Śrīla Prabhupāda

## Beauty

> “My Lord, when Kṛṣṇa came to this planet and manifested the powers of His internal energy, the most wonderful of everything was His form. During all the time of His pastimes on this planet, we had the opportunity to behold His beauty, before which no one could stand. By His internal energy He displayed such magnificence that it astonished everyone. He was so beautiful that He needed no ornaments at all. In truth, it was not the ornaments that adorned Kṛṣṇa, but His beauty, reflected in them, made them beautiful.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.2.12*

> “Once Kṛṣṇa accidentally saw the reflection of His beautiful body in the jewels on the floor. Seeing this reflection, He expressed His feelings in this way: ‘I have never seen anything more beautiful! Although this is Myself, still, following Rādhārāṇī, I try to embrace My own reflection in order to relish heavenly bliss!’”
> — Rūpa Gosvāmī, *Lalita-mādhava*

The physical body **cannot be beautiful by itself**. For example, a dead body, even if it looks beautiful, repels our feelings. In fact, something else attracts us in a living person.

The body, by the design of the Creator, is harmoniously composed of various parts which, when taken separately, also have repulsive properties. For example, beautiful eyes, a nose, teeth, hands, or anything else, when separated from the body, inspire horror in many people. Surgeons can endure these unpleasant things because they think about saving a person’s life. This is a correct perception, for **life itself cannot be taken apart**; that is unnatural. The spirit is indivisible.

When the separate parts of the body are harmoniously connected with each other, thus serving as a convenient machine for the indivisible soul, then its beauty is manifested.

When the body **expresses the mood of the soul**, it becomes very attractive. But if the state of the soul and mind has no connection with a person’s behavior, then it is ugly.

For example, when we see a high-speed racing car, we already admire the person who will sit behind the wheel of such an incredibly swift, and therefore beautiful, machine. We expect a hero. But suddenly a coward appears, who is afraid even to imagine himself in a race. We are disappointed. This is ugly. This car does not suit him; it has simply disgraced the man.

Similarly, we may see a very well-dressed gentleman, confident and representing a whole firm. Such a person is attractive. But as soon as we notice greed in him, his respectable beauty becomes repulsive, like a dead body.

Another example: a priest who speaks very loftily, relying on the scriptures, but if his way of life resembles the life of an animal, then such behavior **devalues his beautiful words**.

In the age of Kali, people usually **confuse beauty with sexuality**. For example, they think that long, loose hair is beautiful. It may be beautiful, but this is beauty in the mode of passion — it is provocative. Modern women like to walk with loose hair and immodest clothing; nowadays this is considered beautiful.

**Psychologist’s note:**

Few of these women suspect that they attract not love, but **lust**, and arouse in a man the desire to possess. And indeed, men, like males, begin their “mating dance”: they give gifts, say compliments, perform other feats, driven by the desire to possess. But as soon as they achieve what they want, their interest inevitably fades. And it is hard to blame them for this, because behind beautiful hair and long legs they saw only a body — and interest in the body cannot be lasting. The inner, true feminine beauty does not concern a man at all under this type of interest.

And men put on suits resembling armor. Others shave their heads and dress in such a way as to inspire fear, clothing themselves in leather and hanging themselves with iron. They too, by this, attract attention to their bodies, while their inner world remains closed.

There is **beauty in passion** — it is provocative. There is **beauty in ignorance** — it is frightening. And there is **beauty in goodness** — it is loving and pacifying.

We are attracted to beauty in others, being conditioned by the modes of material nature, and according to these same modes we receive the result.

One way or another, everyone wants to be beautiful. But as soon as a person immerses himself in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa, he **naturally becomes beautiful**, reflecting His beauty, just as even a small dewdrop reflects the whole sun.

> “Any woman decorated with tilaka and vermilion appears very beautiful. Generally, when a woman’s lips are painted with reddish saffron or vermilion, she becomes very attractive. But when a person’s consciousness and intelligence are not illuminated by thoughts of Kṛṣṇa, they become gloomy and dull, and no matter how sharp a person’s intelligence may be, it brings him no benefit.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 4.26.25*,
> Commentary by Śrīla Prabhupāda

Thus, beauty is a **living being not darkened by material vices**, a pure spirit that originates in the splendor and beauty of Kṛṣṇa.

The path of realizing beauty is interesting and fascinating. A family that knows how to value beauty can live without ever tiring of being amazed by life. When a person is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then everything around becomes auspicious and beautiful — this is also Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

But if beauty is not connected with Kṛṣṇa, then it becomes **deceptive**, like a mirror reflection. Trying to embrace a beautiful reflection, we run into glass or fall into water. Śrīla Prabhupāda called such beauty **“liquid beauty”** — consisting of the components of the body: mucus, blood, flesh, urine, and so on. For a person deceived by liquid beauty, life becomes full of unpleasant surprises.

The true sense of beauty originally comes from Kṛṣṇa, and then is transmitted from one person to another. Being in the forest of Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa says to Balarāma:

> “The grasses, creepers, and various plants have also attained the good fortune of being touched by Your lotus feet. By touching the creepers with Your hands, You cover them with glory. The mountains and rivers are also glorified because You glance at them. And certainly the girls of Vraja, the cowherd maidens, attracted by Your beauty, are the most beautiful of all, because You embrace them with Your strong arms.”

Beauty is the **limitless treasure of Kṛṣṇa**, to which all living beings are related. There is beauty of form, beauty of sound, beauty of word and thought, beauty of poetry and color, beauty of relationships.

Beauty is a **powerful stimulus for the manifestation of love**.

The śāstras say that a wife should decorate herself to look beautiful for her husband. Her devotion to her husband makes her attractive and evokes respect from others. In other words, a woman’s beauty should be **emphasized by devotion to her husband**, and not be the property of everyone.

And any man is beautiful when he is **kind**. A king is attractive when he is strong and just, a brāhmaṇa attracts by knowledge, a vaiśya by generosity, and a śūdra by devotion to those whom he serves.

Goodness will teach us true beauty, the understanding of which is expressed in service to Kṛṣṇa in all diversity — in song and dance, in literature and painting, in service to society, in wealth and prosperity. It will open to us a world of new art, where there are no actors and spectators, but every participant is part of a single **festival of the soul**, like in one family.


## The Lie of Kali-yuga

We say: man, woman, children, parents, beautiful, ugly, duty, honor, and so on. But **whatever we say in the age of Kali will be a lie**, because this is the age of falsehood. In an atmosphere of hostility and hypocrisy it is extremely difficult to speak the truth. Therefore the ācāryas call this world **the place of cheated cheaters**.

For example, how can one call a man someone’s husband if he does not know his real marital duties? But what should we call him if he is formally married and has a family? Of course, we will say: “husband.” But that will be a lie.

Śrīla Prabhupāda once said jokingly that in the West there are no men and women — there are only animals. In Kali-yuga, people and things **do not correspond to their names**.

For example, someone will say: “Listen to what the scientists say, here before you is a laureate of such-and-such a prize.” And people will listen, not even suspecting that they have already been deceived.

Śrīla Prabhupāda said:

> “But how can one trust the intelligence of a scientist? His senses are imperfect, he is prone to illusion, he commits mistakes and he cheats. The scientist does not possess perfect knowledge, and yet he poses as a teacher. That is cheating. And people are so foolish that they believe him.”

Once my Guru Mahārāja said: “The modern world is a society of cheaters and the cheated.” Unfortunately, the cheated glorify the cheaters — thus small cheaters worship big ones.

Suppose a herd of donkeys comes here and starts praising me: “Oh, you are Jagad-guru!” What is their praise worth? But if a gentleman or an educated person praises, then his words have value. Usually, however, both those who praise and those who are praised are ignorant. As it is said in the Vedas:

**saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ** — a small animal praises a big one.

Someone may be proud that his wife is the first beauty, or that his daughter is the child of a famous politician. Someone is proud of his husband because he is very rich. Someone is proud of his ancestry, and someone of his children and grandchildren. All this Śrīla Prabhupāda called with one word: **“sexual life.”**

In Kali-yuga there is nothing real. There is no real politics, no real wealth, no beauty, no real husbands and wives, no real children and grandchildren. There is only sexual life in all its variety.

In Kali-yuga, a young man, having put on saffron dhotī, will think that he has become a brahmacārī, and the bride and groom, having received a marriage certificate, will think that they have become husband and wife. A man who was engaged in useless activity, upon retiring, will consider himself a respectable person. And the dead will be given monuments as if they were saints.

Illicit sex will be considered great love, smoking will be associated with deep thinking, drug addiction and drunkenness will be considered a search for the meaning of life, gambling a way to survive, and eating the corpses of animals healthy food.

> “Brahmacārīs will be unable to keep their vows and will become generally unclean, householders will become beggars, vānaprasthas will live in villages, and sannyāsīs will become greedy for wealth.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 12.3.33*

> “In Kali-yuga people will be useless and will be ruled by women. They will abandon their fathers, brothers, other relatives and friends and instead associate with the brothers and sisters of their wives. Thus the concept of friendship will be based exclusively on sexual ties.”
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 12.3.37*

Many men and women in Kali-yuga want to be “friends” outside marriage, from time to time entering into sexual relations. They call irresponsible love **freedom**. And men often become friends only in order to break laws together profitably. Illegal activity unites large groups of people, and sometimes entire parties. **Virtue is fragmented.**

The true face of Kali-yuga is in fact horrifying: under countless good masks of lies and under false names hides an impure, lustful animal.

And only **one Name** can be considered genuine, capable of exposing all the deception of Kali, just as the sun alone can disperse thick, enveloping fog — **the Name of God**.

> “O brothers, if you want to be saved from the dog-like age of Kali, then take the name of the savior of the fallen, Śrī Śacī-nandana, who delivers everyone from the fear of Kali-yuga.”
> — Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura

> **kali-kukkura:**
> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> “In the age of Kali there is no other way, no other way, no other way for self-realization than chanting, chanting, chanting the holy names of the Lord.”

God is great and powerful, and His Name is just as great and powerful. The name “Kṛṣṇa” cannot be something that excludes or deprives something of the right to exist. On the contrary, it is **all-inclusive**. Everything is in Kṛṣṇa, because He is the source of everything.

This means that **everyone** can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra regardless of nationality, beliefs, age, gender, social, religious, or family status. Everyone will receive full benefit — **as much as he wants**. The problem is only one: a person limits himself.

When Ostap Bender asked Shura Balaganov how much he needed for complete happiness, he immediately named the exact sum: 100 rubles. Someone else thinks in millions or billions. But what do such numbers mean to Kṛṣṇa?

What is the most valuable thing in all three worlds? **He Himself.** Therefore devotees ask for love of God, in order to possess Kṛṣṇa, who possesses everything.

In our Hare Kṛṣṇa movement everyone chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra — brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, and sannyāsīs; beginners and spiritual teachers. The difference between them is only in **their understanding of what they are chanting and why**.

In the gṛhastha-āśrama in Kali-yuga there is **no other way, no other way, no other way** than chanting the holy names of God. If a family man honestly fulfills his duty to his family and at the same time sincerely serves the spiritual master, without deceiving anyone, then he will undoubtedly attain spiritual perfection and return to God, even if he acted imperfectly due to the influence of Kali-yuga.

> “A lie harms only the one who directs it at people bound to him by a common goal.”
> — *Mahābhārata*

It is difficult to live in this age without deception, but **one must never betray one’s guru and one’s family**. For this one simply needs to chant the Holy Name, carefully avoiding offenses.

A gṛhastha who chants without offenses **attains liberation and acquires love of God even while living in the family**. Kali-yuga no longer has power over him, because true love cannot be deceived, and he can give love for Kṛṣṇa to all those who are dear to him.


## The Spiritual Master

One can become free from false designations **only by the mercy of the spiritual master**, because the conditioned living being is afraid to give up false names and labels. A person thinks that in doing so he may lose himself. “I am a man,” “I am a woman” — these are false designations, but how can one give them up? To become nobody while living in human society seems the most frightening thing. But fear is just another deception.

One simply needs to tear oneself away from the reflection and look at the original. If we have found the original, the reflection does not disappear, does it? In the same way, we can remember: “I am a servant of God,” and then see that in one case this servant is a man, and in another case a woman.

Therefore the philosophy is very simple: **change nothing in your life, but add Kṛṣṇa consciousness.** People are afraid because they think they must give up many things that are important to them — family, work, friends. This is not true. We are not walking the path of rejection, but the path of accepting something more valuable. Therefore it is said that on this path there are no losses, and a person becomes free from all fears.

The spiritual master gives his disciples **love for God** in the form of Vedic knowledge and the mood of devotion. But what does he receive in return? He does not receive love for God in return, but ordinary, human love from his disciples, regulated by his own instructions. All disciples love their spiritual master. How spiritual is this love? It can be considered spiritual **only if it impels the disciple to serve the mission of the spiritual master.** Thus even material, human love can be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa.

This is the difference between a human being and other forms of life: **he can serve God if he has a guru.**

The same is true in the family: we have human love, which can easily be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa if it is not turned into sexual entertainment. For this a spiritual master is needed, so that marriage does not degrade us to the level of pigs, camels, cats, and dogs.

Why is a family man glorified when he has many children, but a pig is not? Because he is now **a representative of God for them, or a spiritual teacher.** The first thing children begin to do when they acquire intelligence is to ask difficult questions, and the father and mother teach them. And if they teach without deception, then they are gurus. Love gives them the right to punish and to instruct.

> Psychologist’s Note

Whether we like it or not, regardless of all our shortcomings and imperfections of character, **we are natural spiritual teachers for our children.**

There is a tribe of Indians in South America whose way of life is astonishingly reminiscent of the Vedic one. The tribe has a Guru who resolves all complex issues related to the life of the tribe. He is an unquestionable authority for them — not simply because he is elected to this position, but precisely because of the qualities of his character. This tribe is famous for its truly remarkable spiritual teachers.

Even modern psychologists have taken an interest in the phenomenon of such influence on others. The tribe is distinguished by extraordinarily warm relationships among themselves, hospitality, strong families, and obedient, well-developed children. All members of the tribe are able to express their opinions openly, and yet the word of the Guru is final for them.

It is interesting how the tribe chooses its spiritual teacher. Before leaving his body, the Guru predicts the appearance of an infant who will become the next Guru. He points to a pregnant woman who, in his opinion, is carrying the future Guru, and from that moment this woman and her husband move into a cave specially prepared for this purpose. The cave is very comfortably arranged, and from that time the whole tribe takes great care that this family lacks nothing.

The woman spends the entire pregnancy in this cave, listening to the instructions of the spiritual master, and after giving birth she continues to remain there. The child does not leave the cave, and after some time the Guru begins his training. He tells him everything: who he is, who others are, who God is, how the universe is created, what the tasks of people are, and what his future mission will be.

When the training is completed, the boy must come out into the world. The whole tribe prepares to meet him when he leaves the cave. He sees everything with the eyes that the spiritual master has given him: he sees the Sun as the eye of God, the mountains and rivers as the body of God, and other people as particles of God. He still has much to learn in the world, but **his vision of reality has already been formed.**

Amazingly, **the same thing happens with our children, and once it happened with us.** Only our cave is our home, and our gurus are our parents. The child begins to look at this world through the eyes of his parents; the same understanding of the world is formed in us as exists in our family. Later all this goes into the subconscious and becomes our unconscious guide through life. That is why there is family karma, where many people repeat the same mistakes in a circle, and it is very difficult to go beyond family scenarios.


### Five Methods of Instruction in the Śāstras

**Matsya-tantra** — just as a fish takes care of its offspring simply by occasionally glancing at them, so the guru transmits full knowledge by his gestures and behavior, leaving the disciples to develop and improve themselves.

**Kūrma-tantra** — just as a turtle leaves its eggs on land to develop by themselves, but constantly thinks of them while remaining in the water, so the guru teaches the disciple all aspects of knowledge while being at a distance, but at the same time lets him know that he thinks of him with great hope.

**Bhramara-tantra** — just as a bumblebee acts toward a caterpillar as if constantly stinging it, and thus, through constant contact, the caterpillar becomes a bumblebee, so the guru continuously watches over his disciple, urging him to think, to gain knowledge, and to develop his own abilities and qualities.

**Mārjāra-tantra** — just as a cat protects its kitten until it is fully grown, so the guru constantly cares for and teaches the disciple until he attains full knowledge and maturity.

**Markaṭa-tantra** — just as a monkey protects and feeds its young when and how it likes, despite the fact that the young are always clinging to the mother, so the guru teaches the disciple when and how he sees fit, even though the disciple is constantly near him.


The less lust and sense of proprietorship the father or mother has, the more knowledge they are able to give their children. One type of education is to train a child for oneself, for one’s family, and for the family he will have in the future. Another type is to raise him **for Kṛṣṇa**, without fear for his future.

Father and mother should try to combine both kinds of education, although the material nature of parents and children will never allow them to fully renounce their family relationships. Therefore parents do not give their child dīkṣā, initiation — this is undesirable — but they should try to give such knowledge that **leads to dīkṣā**.

If the child is not interested in initiation, he is allowed to live according to his own choice, but **saintly parents always pray for their unfortunate children, and their prayers are very powerful.**


## Happiness

The happiness of devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so transcendental and unlimited that **no other kind of happiness can be compared with it**. It is said that even one drop of happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness far surpasses an entire ocean of happiness that any other activity can give. Therefore, one who has managed to develop even a tiny particle of pure devotional service can very easily renounce the happiness derived from religiosity, economic prosperity, sense gratification, and even liberation.

— **Śrīla Prabhupāda, The Nectar of Devotion**

Once Śrīla Prabhupāda said that **the duty of the guru is to see that no one around him suffers**. Since the ultimate cause of suffering is ignorance, lack of knowledge, then a difficult task is placed upon the spiritual teacher, the king, and the parents: **to eliminate ignorance and bring happiness to those who depend on them**.

This is difficult, because for those who are in ignorance, **the very source of their “happiness” is ignorance itself**, and only possessing a higher happiness can one distract people from their habitual, harmful pleasures.

For example, when hippie drug addicts asked Prabhupāda what Kṛṣṇa consciousness was, he figuratively answered them that **Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a room completely filled with LSD**. Those who were able to understand his example gave up all their bad habits.

People tend to think that happiness is something brought from outside. They say: “You’re lucky to have such a husband,” or “such a profession,” “such good children.” But in reality, **any happiness in the material world is achieved through effort**. Luck is the fruit of previous austerities. Therefore happiness and austerity are inseparably connected. No one will ever be lucky who has performed no austerities in this or previous lives.

If a devotee gṛhastha already possesses the higher taste of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then his happiness in service will **automatically spread to his whole family**. But if he does not, then he needs effort and austerity to maintain an atmosphere of joy in the family. And this too is difficult.

For example, a devotee should not become like a stage performer who can entertain the audience, making them laugh and rejoice for half an hour or more, but then himself needs rest. **No one can be a constant source of happiness for others** — such a role is, in essence, the highest form of exploitation. Only God is inexhaustible.

Usually the head of the family comes home tired, and sometimes upset. He wants to forget himself at least for a while, but his wife and children are waiting for communication and joy from him. It is difficult to be a “happy artist” at home. Everyone knows how a family can become tiresome with its endless requests.

Therefore, the process of learning happy relationships comes down to this: **each person must learn to be self-satisfied**. There is sorrow from the mind, but there is also happiness from the mind. The state of mind in which a person draws joy from within himself is called yoga, or connection with God. This is the science of happiness, and every person can learn it and teach it to his children.

The secret of this science is that **one must become accustomed to the austerity of service**.

At first, parents teach children to rejoice in activity. If a group of children is given complete freedom, they will quickly start quarrelling, fighting, and cruelly offending each other. Therefore parents must occupy them with games that bring joy.

Then children must be taught to enjoy their own creative abilities — drawing, music, dancing, and so on. The ability to create increases their happiness, especially when there is success: if the parents like a drawing, the child is happy. But if they do not like it, difficulties appear. How then can one be happy?

Here Vedic culture offers an interesting solution. The child is taught to do what he does **not for himself, but for the pleasure of God**. For example, children draw Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, and this is praised regardless of the result. God can be pleased even by clumsy drawing if the process was sincere.

Therefore, in ancient Vedic culture, no artist depicting the pastimes of God ever thought of signing his painting or making a career from it, although people knew and loved great masters. The point is that **talent used in God’s service glorified God, not the person**. The artist received recognition as His servant, from Him Himself, and therefore did not belittle the abilities of others by enjoying his own superiority.

Thus people were freed from false pride and did not suffer from inequality of abilities, but developed sincere love for God. If you did not become an artist, it means you have another destiny from above. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, **every person can use what he has been given and be happy within himself**. Absolutely everyone can be given a useful role — which means absolutely everyone can be happy.

In theory this sounds simple, but in practice it is not easy to be happy when you see that someone is better than you. This must be learned from parents and gurus who have realized **the equality of all living beings before God**. They will say: “God is the Father; He loves everyone equally.” This is understandable to any child if his own father in the family was like that — loving all living beings and treating all children equally well.

Śrīla Prabhupāda explains:

> “In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said: sarva-yoniṣu — in all species of life there is the soul. The body is like a suit of clothes. You wear black, I wear saffron, but under the clothes you are a person and I am also a person. Similarly, the bodies of different species are just different types of clothing. There are 8,400,000 species of life, but under each is a spiritual soul, an inseparable part of God.

> Suppose a man has two sons with different abilities. One may be a Supreme Court judge and the other a simple worker, but the father considers both his sons. He does not think the judge-son is more important. And if the judge-son said, ‘My dear father, your other son is useless, let me slaughter him and eat him,’ would the father allow this?”

— **Śrīla Prabhupāda, Conversation with Cardinal Danielou**


A family should become **a school of happiness and love**. A true gṛhastha knows how to be happy both spiritually and materially; otherwise this way of life has no meaning and cannot be called an āśrama.

Creating such āśramas is an important mission of our time. A great and difficult work awaits us, and therefore we must help one another, forming **community consciousness — one for all and all for one**.

Śrīla Prabhupāda pointed out several important points in creating communities:

1. In families there must always be **first-class food**.
2. There must be **beautiful, practical things**, not inferior to works of art.
3. If in one family any difficulty arises, **all others immediately help**.

Moreover, in communities devotees should help one another not only spiritually, reminding each other of God, but also materially, in order to reduce any suffering. Any help coming from a devotee of God should be accepted with gratitude, as if **the Lord Himself were doing it**.

As Buddha said: “There is no happiness equal to peace.” Peace comes when people become devotees of God and are confident in His protection and in the help of His devotees. Thus families will attain happiness, although life by nature is difficult.


Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 8.12.2:

> “Mahārāja Bali said: You have explained that a householder should follow those religious principles which do not interfere with maintaining material prosperity, satisfying the senses, keeping a good reputation, and providing for his livelihood. I also think that such is the dharma of a householder.”

The dharma of a householder is **to maintain material well-being and economic prosperity** so that people can enjoy life in a dignified way, not like thieves. Therefore a householder has the right to enjoy life within the laws of family and society.

Accidental, unintentional sins will be easily cleansed by the practice of devotional service. **But a devotee must never commit sin intentionally.** He should be protected from this tendency by his family, the society of devotees, and his own conscience.

Then, when the devotee exhausts all possibilities of pious enjoyment, he will begin to show a firm interest in liberation.

[The long Bhāgavatam commentaries about Mahārāja Bali and Yayāti explain that **as soon as a person sincerely decides to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa immediately helps him become free**, just as a fledgling leaves the nest once its wings grow strong.]


At some point, the devotee will no longer want to live among materialists, even pious ones. He will want to go to the forest — **but not an ordinary forest: the forest of Vṛndāvana**.

The Bhāgavatam explains that after fifty years one should consciously leave family life and go to the forest. **The best forest is Vṛndāvana**, because there one can always remember Kṛṣṇa, since there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His abode.

But one must not go to Vṛndāvana while still lusty. To live in Vṛndāvana and remain absorbed in sex desire is a terrible offense — such people are compared to monkeys and pigs, who also live there but are controlled only by reproduction instinct. Such people are called **māyā-mṛga** — animals of illusion.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took sannyāsa to show mercy to these māyā-mṛgas. Therefore everyone should develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness and always think of Kṛṣṇa. **Then he will be fit to live in Vṛndāvana and make his life successful.**

It is very good for householders to regularly come to Vṛndāvana to feel the eternal pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and to develop deep attachment to Them in the heart.


> “One who knows that material happiness, which brings both joy and sorrow and comes in this life or the next, on Earth or in heaven, is temporary and illusory, and who knows that intelligent people should not strive for it, has understood the soul. Such a person understands that material happiness is the main cause of repeated existence in this world and forgetfulness of one’s real position.”

— **Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 9.19.20**

## Afterword

Frankly speaking, it was **very difficult to write this book**. I was constantly accompanied by the feeling that I was walking on a razor’s edge. It is very easy to deviate by following the feelings of family people, especially if they are unhappy and live without love and without a mission. I did not want to be harsh and heartless toward weak, suffering families, but at the same time **it was impossible to compromise with the Absolute Truth**. Even the smallest compromise can become a loophole for godlessness.

*Abhyutthānam adharmasya* — irreligion, godlessness, penetrates in small quantities and then becomes predominant. This is how it happens over time, and later it is very difficult to find the cause of the decline. Therefore Nārada Muni once asked Yudhiṣṭhira **very important questions** — questions about the most essential things, to which a guru, a king, and parents must be able to give answers.

> “Having been respectfully received by all the Pāṇḍavas, that great sage, expert in the Vedas, asked Yudhiṣṭhira about the main things: about the laws of God, love, and worldly benefit.

> Nārada said: Are your riches serving you properly? Does your mind take shelter in dharma? Do you enjoy the pleasures of life? Is your spirit weakening? Do you, before the eyes of people, follow pious conduct in accordance with dharma and benefit, the conduct followed by your forefathers? Do you violate dharma for the sake of benefit, or benefit for the sake of dharma, or both of them for the sake of love, whose essence is enjoyment?”

Nowadays more and more devotees talk about love. It even becomes fashionable. Of course, no one in this world can be against love. **But in this noble aspiration there is a danger**, because adharma, godlessness, comes precisely **in the guise of love**.

In reality, the problem is not whether to love or not to love, but **to learn how to love**. For this one must understand the laws of God and be useful to the whole Vaiṣṇava society. And for that one must be honest.

Thinking about worldly benefit and advantage, a person forgets the laws of God and begins to care only about self-preservation, whose ideal becomes a “healthy lifestyle” and a peaceful mood. However, the highest aspiration of people in this world is love, **for the sake of which they often sacrifice both the laws of God and useful existence**, simply because love brings the highest pleasure. Therefore, in order to save the soul, the śāstras recommend **first directing human love toward God**, and only then toward everything else that surrounds a person.

A man should not think that by falling in love with a woman he has become fallen, and also should not think that he has become perfect. **Both are unjust** to a human being, because a human being is created for self-realization. This means that love, whatever it may be, is given to him for development. It is like a teacher of life — it can both encourage and punish him.

Nowadays, most often there is no great, all-consuming love between spouses, but there is **friendship on equal terms**, as well as parental relationships with children. This can be quite enough for a happy family life. But if someone does not want to accept such simple happiness and seeks some “special” love, **this position is dangerous** and can contaminate the heart.

Love cannot be searched for like an item in a shop. **It comes by itself and in its own time, like a teacher.** If the student is ready, the teacher comes. And if someone wants to be deceived, then false love will come — and it will become the highest form of punishment.

Thus, living without love for God and having lost interest in each other, many gṛhasthas will suffer, engaging in sex without clear boundaries or looking for a way out in divorce. **Neither one nor the other will make a person happy.**

We hear many questions from family people exactly about this:

* “Should we have sex or not? And if so, how?”
* “Should we divorce or not?”
* “What should we do so that the husband changes?”
* “What should we do so that the children become pure devotees?”
* “What should we do if relatives are demons?”
* etc.

The honest answer is only one: **develop renunciation from material happiness and go to God — then everyone will be happy.**

As many people as there are in this world, so many problems there are. If even **one person goes to Kṛṣṇa**, there will be one problem less here. The only exception are pure devotees, who do not create problems, because **they do not seek happiness in this world**.

If gṛhasthas are very attached to and demanding of their family happiness, **they are doomed to suffering**. One must remember that we live here simply **to repay our debts and help each other return to God**. In this alone there is already much love and joy, because our relationships on the path to God become ecstatic.

Many devotees cannot follow all the regulative principles in family life. This especially concerns sexual life. Then some of them suffer from an inferiority complex, and others want to establish **other, new principles**. Both are deviations, adharma. Some think they are failed ācāryas, and others, in spite of everything, continue to consider themselves ācāryas. **These are two foolishnesses, two sides of one coin called “False Pride.”**

One simply needs to remember that **we have a chance to return to God** and go there — whether by climbing with all our remaining strength or by crawling, as long as there is at least some possibility.

The regulative principles given to us by Śrīla Prabhupāda **do not need to be changed**, but we need to try to change ourselves. Failures should not confuse us or drive us into depression, because **we have the support of the paramparā and the society of devotees**. Let us continue our path, no matter how difficult it may seem.

Family people must not be criticized for their attachments, because **this is an offense to a Vaiṣṇava**. Family life is under the protection of the laws of God, and any deviations bring suffering to the family — through the man and the woman, who are simultaneously conductors of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and of māyā.

In other words, **a family of sincere devotees is a self-sufficient, self-regulating cell of society**, or a strong boat for crossing the ocean of suffering. Therefore **no one should interfere without being asked** in the relationships of gṛhasthas or criticize their behavior.

The behavior of husband and wife is very difficult to understand from outside. **They themselves must seek the path to perfection**, consulting Kṛṣṇa in the heart and remembering the instructions of the spiritual master. It is also very good to have experienced mentors in family life, which by its very nature is full of dangers.

But the most important thing is **to be sincere devotees of God**.


# Letters from Gṛhasthas

### (Letter)

It seems I’ve understood the secret of family life: **you have to be lucky with your wife**. I look at other husbands and think: *I wouldn’t endure that, I couldn’t live like that, there I would probably divorce for sure.* In all our short ten years of life together, we have never once quarreled. Only I have quarreled. She probably knows some secrets, because the Vedas say that the husband should give children, ornaments, and so on, while in ten years I have given very little — and yet she remains humble and patient.

Perhaps there is some childlike quality in her behavior that sometimes makes me treat her like a child. For example, I imagine telling her now that I’ve written everything about her and sent it, but won’t show it to her. Her mouth will open, her eyes will widen, and she’ll start whining like a child:

— *What? What? Come on, show me. Come o-on…*

But if, God forbid, I get sick, then she is no longer a child, but a loving mother:

— *All right, march to bed.*

Then she opens a thick book on Ayurveda:

— *Oh, I know what you need.*

After that she prescribes a dozen recipes and spends the whole day preparing medicines for me. Although they usually don’t help, she is very serious about it. It even seems that she’s waiting for me to get sick so that she can sit next to me for a while and give me something to drink.

As a friend she is ideal, especially in practical matters, when money has to be counted. She always counts for me and doesn’t let me make mistakes. The following dialogues are regular.

— *Gauravani, today I made a mistake. I’m in māyā.*
— *Well yes. You’re in māyā. So don’t make mistakes anymore, okay? It’s just a mistake. Everything will pass.*
— *What?! You also think I made a mistake?!*
— *No, that’s not what I meant. What kind of mistake is that? I would have done the same.*

As a wife, she binds me by her devotion. If I’m sitting on the balcony reading a book and she comes back from the store, she immediately goes looking for me. When she finds me, she calms down, and only then goes to undress and unpack the bags. She is always young and beautiful and by her very appearance **prevents me from forgetting Kṛṣṇa and forces me to always remember Him**. I have to remember His eternal companions, the beautiful gopīs. I think that Lord Indra already envies me, especially when in the evening, after washing the floor in the whole apartment, she sits on the sofa, opens *The Nectar of Devotion*, nods off over it, then asks me to be sure to wake her up at half past three — and, as usual, sleeps until five.

It’s a pity that someday we will have to part. She dreams of going to the spiritual world first.

### (Letter)

That evening I came home later than usual, having stayed after work at a lecture on the *Bhagavad-gītā*. For half a year now I had become interested in Vaiṣṇava culture and philosophy. I began chanting japa, stopped eating meat, and tried to attend lectures, programs, and festivals whenever possible. Although my relatives were not thrilled about it, **all this gave me immense joy**. And now my mood was extraordinary. I wanted to share with everyone the joy that was overflowing in me after associating with devotees.

— *Take your things and get out of here!* — my wife declared as soon as I crossed the threshold.

Prabhupāda’s books stacked near the door and my things lying in a heap on the floor confirmed the seriousness of her words. A real Kurukṣetra.

— *You’re cheating on me with Kṛṣṇa! My patience is over, and we need to separate. Go to your Temple if you like it there so much.*

As if there had never been long years of life together, with all their difficulties and joys.

— *You’ll go to Kṛṣṇa anyway, so go now — good riddance.*

*If only I had such confidence,* I thought admiringly, about my wife’s “blessing.”

Take my things and go to the Temple? Everything had been moving in that direction for a long time. First there was her hysteria about my refusal to buy and cook meat and about having separate dishes in the kitchen. Then the scandal about the pictures of Kṛṣṇa. I won’t even mention the mockery about the bead bag and the finger sticking out of it. All my intense attempts to explain my present behavior ran into a deaf wall of misunderstanding. What else does a woman need? I bring my whole salary home, I don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t swear.

Meanwhile the scandal continued according to all the laws of the genre — with shouting, tears, and reproaches about ruined youth, lack of attention, the apartment, and money. I have nothing to object. In her own way she is right. Normal people think about how to earn more money and go home after work, not to lectures on the *Bhagavad-gītā*. Maybe I really am trying to run away from family responsibilities into a wonderful Indian fairy tale?

Many times I tried not to stay late at evening programs. But when the singing of devotees pours streams of nectar over you, when anxieties and sorrow leave — it is impossible to just get up and leave.

Strangely, I do not answer my wife’s reproaches, I only silently endure. That is completely unlike me. Inside there is neither anger nor irritation. Should I list all her faults? And why? There is no desire to do so. And before, the smallest excuse was enough for me to actively join the exchange of insults. As if a wall of calmness surrounds me. Only now do I begin to understand the power of the Holy Name.

Everything ends sooner or later. My wife spoke out and calmed down. Prabhupāda’s books and my things returned to their places. As befits a family man, I stayed home that night. But **where is my real home, and where is my real family?** And if I cannot convince the people closest to me of simple truths, then whom can I convince of anything at all?

— *Kṛṣṇa, if You are so smart, if You control everything, then You deal with my wife Yourself,* — I said to Him that evening. — *I understood that I can’t do anything myself. Well, unless You even need it at all.*

Having thus shifted all responsibility for solving my family problems onto Kṛṣṇa, I felt great relief and went to sleep.

And Kṛṣṇa did not make me wait. First, my wife accepted the authority of Prabhupāda. No, she did not begin to read his books. But in difficult situations she began to address him personally. This happened during a serious threat of pregnancy complications, when she was praying to all the saints. And after she turned to Prabhupāda, whose photograph hung on the wall, she said that she felt an unusual violet glow nearby and someone’s presence. The pregnancy problems did not return, and Prabhupāda’s photo moved into her handbag.

She also says that Prabhupāda guides her when she looks for lost things and turns to him. I am still far from that. She believed in the power of tulasī neck beads and sometimes wears them against the evil eye. And the problems with my attending programs were solved surprisingly easily. Three times a week in the evenings I go to lectures and programs, if there are no urgent matters at home, and this does not cause any special objections from my wife.

So I understood that **everything in this world depends on Kṛṣṇa**. And if He wants it, everyone around will be satisfied. And family life is simply a magnificent opportunity to learn about one’s own shortcomings — and, most importantly, an opportunity to practice humility.

When Chaitanya Chandra Charan Prabhu came to Vladivostok, I told him:

— *My wife thinks I’m cheating on her with Kṛṣṇa.*
— *Yes, that’s how it is,* — he replied.
— *What should I tell her?*
— *Give her more time.*

I thought for a long time about this seemingly simple and obvious advice. If I give more time to family affairs, there will be less time left for associating with devotees. Then I will be cheating on Kṛṣṇa. What should I do? I don’t know. But perhaps someday it will dawn on me that **all people without exception around me are devotees of Kṛṣṇa**, and simply by reminding them of this, I will be able to serve Him always and everywhere.

### (Letter)

Our family is already twenty years old. For both of us this is our second marriage. From our first marriages, both he and I had children. Even deciding to marry with such an inheritance from the past was not so easy, but we always had the desire to be together, regardless of the difficulties.

My husband had great interest in what I was doing and always helped me in my development, supporting all new ideas and undertakings. And there were many ideas: we were developing alternative medicine in Russia, opening the first private medical center, mastering new related professions. I write “we” deliberately, because although my husband was a businessman, he literally went into everything — helping organize events, attending lectures himself, studying alternative medicine — and today I can say with joy that he is a good professional in these fields. Interestingly, in the end he came to work in an area in one way or another connected with medicine and even made a successful career.

We are both strong leaders, and sometimes it is not easy for us with each other. There were different periods in our relationship. The period of romantic love lasted quite a long time: for ten whole years we celebrated the 25th of every month — the day we met each other. It was a sacred date for both of us. We would think how to please each other, give something unusual and refined, and обязательно spend this day together. After ten years this date began to be celebrated only once a year, but it remains important for us even now. And we do not celebrate our wedding day — we celebrate the day of our meeting.

As a woman, it was not easy for me to accept that the day finally came when he forgot the 25th for the first time — and I was waiting. Then, of course, there were tears and hurt feelings. Thus, little by little, another period began, when we started to learn not only the romantic sides of each other.

My husband is an Eastern man, and in the East it is not customary for a man to take the first step toward reconciliation, even if he is in the wrong. Therefore all the steps toward peace, toward closeness after quarrels, had to be made by me. I cannot say that it was easy. Sometimes I had to step over myself — as I now understand, over my false ego — knowing that there is responsibility toward the child. However, every time I took this difficult step and apologized, my husband would make a beautiful and noble gesture: he would give flowers, or a small present, or arrange some kind of celebration. In this way he offered his apology — and most importantly, he thanked me for being the first to come forward. Now I can say that he is the chief physician who treats me for egoism.

When we met, we both had nothing except bare enthusiasm, interest, curiosity, the desire to develop, and faith that everything would work out. We always had many friends; they often came to visit us; we shared joys and troubles with them. There were many trials in that period, starting from the fact that sometimes we had nothing to eat. But we never reproached each other for this and were content with what we had. We always valued each other very much and took care that there was a warm atmosphere in the house.

A very large role in our family has always been and still is played by our close ones and relatives. In our home there is a tradition to celebrate all holidays in the circle of family and friends. A table is set, gifts are given, everyone sits together and shares their experiences and achievements. Everyone is very close and dear to one another; we feel the support of the family — whether it is birthdays or, unfortunately, days of funerals. In the family it is accepted that the younger show care and respect toward the elders, and the elders always spoil the younger ones — at least with grandmother’s pies and cheesecakes. Everyone in the family knows that holidays are first celebrated with the family, and only after that one may go to friends, if desired. When we meet, we обязательно sing; we are a very musical family, everyone plays different musical instruments. When children bring their friends into the house, this is always warmly welcomed; it is customary to send treats to the families of friends, and neighbors are treated as well. It is also customary to go together with the children to orphanages and bring them toys and sweets.

My husband has many wonderful qualities; he is a vividly expressed kṣatriya — nobility, generosity, courage, the ability to take responsibility, the ability to protect — but one of his main достоинств is loyalty to friends. However, all these qualities, under the influence of different guṇas, manifest in different ways. With time, prosperity came to our home, and together with it came the desire to enjoy more and more. By that time our friends had also reached good material positions, and everything began to spin according to the same scenario: parties, restaurants, billiards… I won’t list more — everything is already clear. Around that time I met the Society for Krishna Consciousness and immediately began spiritual practice.

I must give my husband his due: he never opposed the fact that God became the main thing for me, nor my vegetarianism, nor the change in my rhythm of life, nor the fact that I stopped going to parties. Although friends still think that I fell into a sect, because before I was so sociable and lively, and now I appear nowhere. As a result, now we have different circles: I am in the society of devotees, and he is in the society of his friends. Of course, this distances us from each other. We have different interests, and this is not easy at all. Sometimes irritation accumulates in him, because he cannot “like a normal person” spend time with his wife, and this irritation grows — for deep inside he recognizes, and he himself says it, that it is more correct to go the spiritual path, but desires are so strong that he cannot do anything about it.

Nevertheless, our family traditions are preserved; we celebrate holidays together, only now the table is divided into vegetarian and non-vegetarian parts.

The children are also given the right of choice. It is not easy for them either, because mother does one thing and father does another. My understanding that he is not simply my husband — that is, not a body belonging to me — but a soul going his own path, helps me overcome emotions. It is easier for me: I have a spiritual teacher, I have devotees who surround me with love and care. And also respect for each other helps both me and my husband, the friendship that is already twenty years old, the ability to see good qualities in each other despite differences, to recognize the freedom of choice of each — and a sense of humor with which we look at our own shortcomings.

I was so happy when my husband himself asked me to invite my spiritual teacher with his family to our home. He listened very attentively, and afterwards said with regret: “Ah, there was too little time for association! You have such a wonderful spiritual teacher!” Sometimes I read him excerpts from the Vedas, and he says that it is very correct and interesting — while continuing to strive for his own company, where he is no less interested. This material world still seems attractive to him, and he finds in it a thousand ways to amuse himself. Apparently good karma — the period of suffering has not yet come, and therefore interest in Vedic knowledge is still only superficial, although he tells his friends about the Vedas and says that a Vedic wife is the best wife.

I wanted so much for him to share my spiritual life with me. I believed that someday this would happen and always prayed, relying on the Lord’s mercy. And it happened. After several years he became a vegetarian. And not long ago he called me at work and, excitedly, began to ask where the books of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* were — he urgently needed to take them to his employees.

I have always thanked my husband for his tact, restraint, generosity, and respect for my choice. And in my turn I tried to respond with the warm atmosphere in the home — for which, I am sure, the woman is responsible — with inner comfort, coziness, and care. Even when we could not walk one path, we had many reasons to value each other, raising our sons in an atmosphere of mutual respect and friendship. I think the indicator of how well we managed this is our children — they are very sensitive barometers. And judging by them, by the mercy of God, we succeeded.

I have been fortunate in this life: I always received joy from association in my parents’ family, in my own family, and now I am very happy that Kṛṣṇa has made my family even bigger — this is the family of devotees. And our family is becoming bigger, closer, and dearer with every day. This is what I feel now.


### (Letter)

My husband is a very serious man, a loving and caring father and husband. But he is such a joker! It is impossible even to be angry with him — he jokes with such a serious face that I simply die of laughter. And this time again, all my questions ended in humor.

Me: What do the relationships in our family rest on?
Him: On my enormous patience!

Me: What qualities in me do you value?
Him: That you go to bed early.

Me: What qualities in yourself do you have to overcome for the sake of preserving the family?
Him: That is the most difficult question!

Me: Is there something in me that makes you feel grateful?
Him: I always say “thank you” after eating.

Me: What efforts do you have to make for the sake of preserving the family?
Him: None at all. You’re sitting far too firmly on my neck.

Me: How are difficulties and misfortunes overcome?
Him: God has been merciful.

Once someone asked him not to joke anymore. He was very upset: “Without jokes I’ll die.”

But those who understand him love him precisely for this. That doesn’t mean I always laugh together with him. No, sometimes his humor drives me into a real rage. But I know for sure that at that moment he is experiencing indescribable happiness. And he jokes only with those who are close to him.

We are raising a daughter, and our relationships have become even deeper.

**HOW MALLIKA LEARNED TO BOW**

When Mallika grew a little, her father and I began to think how to teach her to bow to the Deities. We didn’t want any scare tactics or force. We used a trick. When the bell rang and the altar opened, we both, in one voice (like merchants at a fair), would call out:

“Fresh mahā-prasāda tulasī leaves! Just from the feet of Gaura-Nitāi! Only for the one who bows best to the Deities!”

And Mallika is a great lover of tulasī, so she would drop everything, run, bow down, receive her beloved leaves, and then devour them with great pleasure.

Several years have passed, and now we no longer give out tulasī in huge quantities. But as soon as the bell rings, Mallika runs — uncombed, in pajama pants, or rather in just one pant leg (the other trailing on the floor) — and bows down.

**FAIRY TALES**

It’s not that Mallika doesn’t like brushing her teeth — no. It’s just that this stubborn girl will open her mouth only if, while brushing her teeth, Mommy tells her a story about the Pāṇḍavas or Rāma and Sītā. And not just any story — an invented one. And обязательно a new one every morning.

Thus, to the surprise — and perhaps even horror — of the previous ācāryas, the *Mahābhārata* and *Rāmāyaṇa* are being supplemented with new, previously unknown adventures.

**“VICTORY TO YOU!”**

After watching the TV series *Mahābhārata*, Mallika began to see her father off to work like this:

“Haribol! Āyuṣmān! Victory to you!”

All our neighbors leave for work at about the same time. Imagine: only our dad is wished victory every morning.

These blessings have taken root in our family, and now Dad sends his daughter to gymnastics with the words:

“Āyuṣmān! Victory to you!”

Mallika claims that “Āyuṣmān” means “Long life to you!”

Recently I heard that one devotee husband beats his devotee wife because she performs ācamana incorrectly. She is already over forty, with two children. I thought: when your book comes out, everything will fall into place. But men either don’t read, or don’t draw the right conclusions. So what remains — to hope for female patience?

**HOW WE RESOLVE CONFLICTS**

If we quarrel, I am the first to go and make peace — and always on the same day. You can’t go to sleep upset. This also applies to children: no one is sent to bed with resentment.

Now about my relationship with his mother. It seems that just as husband and wife sometimes need to quarrel a little, here too you can’t do without some friction. It’s just that husband and wife are close people, so it’s easy for them to forgive each other. His mother is also considered a close, dear person: I behave with her easily, simply, in a homely way — but I don’t digest remarks addressed to me so easily.

So long ago a decision was made: not to discuss each other in his presence (he loves both of us). And since it’s not nice to take the trash out of the house (it only makes things worse), then a fire without wood dies out.

It’s impossible to quarrel loudly: the child understands and feels more than we do. Even if we argue in whispers behind the door, she runs in with crazy eyes:

“Again! Stop it immediately!”

She immediately starts thinking that we don’t love each other and worries very much. So sometimes we have to make do with just angry faces at each other.


### (Letter)

I never wanted to get married. My mother used to instruct me like this:
“Don’t rush, dear. Study. You’ll get married at twenty-five and live your life.”
She herself got married at nineteen; she and my father raised four of us children. Apparently, she knew what she was talking about.

She had a rather contemptuous, patronizing attitude toward men, and it passed on to me — and became a hundred times stronger. When my suitors timidly hinted at marriage, I replied with poisonous mockery and sarcasm.

The Soviet system, with all its attributes, influenced the fate of the younger generation in its own special, “Soviet-style” way. Family was considered something unimportant, something not even worth talking about; children were better not mentioned at all, especially at work. A woman was an equal to a man: you had to work, build communism. Everyone was “comrades.” And yet everyone still wanted to be happy.

I saw how many Soviet families lived, and it did not inspire me. The rare exceptions only confirmed the rule.

I did get married — at twenty-six, when many of my peers were already sending their children to school. My future husband “captured” me with his guitar singing, his erudition, and the fact that instead of restaurants he invited me to the theater. He would borrow a jacket and tie from his dorm neighbor, and we’d go to some new premiere. It was all so boring and uninteresting that I even decided to marry him just to somehow diversify my life.

And I said honestly: “If it doesn’t work out, we’ll get divorced.” He still can’t forgive me for that. And I was glad there was such a loophole — divorce — through which one could escape if necessary.

We divorced after twelve years of life together. No, I didn’t want to destroy the family; I endured as long as I could, “built the nest,” our son was already growing up. But it so happened that my patience ran out and we separated.

My husband used to drink before; later, when family life became routine, it turned into a habit. I couldn’t accept that.

At that time my spiritual practice consisted of rarely visiting our Pskov churches and repeating “Our Father” at night, already lying under the blanket. Apparently, I did begin to pray and ask God for help, and once I felt an answer:
“I will not leave you. Everything will be fine.”

My husband left “to nowhere,” with just one small bag in his hand, as soon as I filed for divorce. He didn’t even take anything from the house.

“How noble!” — some people said enviously, those who were forced to live under the same roof with their former spouses.

I explained to my son that Dad and I had decided to live separately for a while so there wouldn’t be daily scandals at home. We tried not to traumatize the child as much as possible.

At first we hardly communicated — out of hurt he didn’t come, didn’t call. Each day was hard to live through. And yet I was happy that I had divorced — life somehow became brighter. The only anxiety was for my son. But he was doing fine, at least outwardly.

With time, relations improved, but we always lived separately. Father and son communicated as much as they wanted. He began to take care of us as best he could, and after some time I felt more “married” than before the divorce.

“You’ve arranged a very convenient life for yourself,” some acquaintances said.

No. It is the Lord who arranges everything in our lives.

My generation created families in an atheistic country. It was completely deprived of even the most basic knowledge of how to build family relationships, of the fact that family is important, that men and women are very different from each other. This ignorance was so habitual that everyone considered themselves a life expert and always right. Many still live like this — and I sincerely pity them.

If the situation in society, in Russia in particular, has changed, then only for the worse. So many stupid, empty magazines, where poor young girls dreaming of a family have nothing to read except about sexy outfits and how to powder their noses properly. And nowhere does it say that such outfits can only attract lustful admirers who aim only at satisfying their instincts — and not at all at creating a good family.

In my youth there were no such monstrous magazines, no flood of advertising, but there was practically no alternative either. Some little books appeared here and there. Maybe I would have been interested in the science of family life if I had known that such a science existed. But instead I just practically did everything that had to be done around the house.

Then, when everything was already almost completely destroyed, I was lucky — like everyone who met devotees and the books of Śrīla Prabhupāda. A little window to the light began to open slowly, with a creak.

It turns out that family is an entire science.

Family life occupies almost the entire span between birth and death. How can one treat it as something accidental or insignificant?! When a person is alone, one single phone call can change everything. But if you are married — you can’t just get out of it like that. I read this in some book.

So if you create a family — do it with full responsibility and complete seriousness. For this, knowledge is needed. Of course, one can learn from one’s own mistakes — but the pain of bumps and bruises brings little joy. And life may not be long enough.

I listened to Lakṣmī Nārāyaṇa Prabhu’s lectures on family life, and it became frightening: imagine what wives can be like — killers, enemies, traitors, and so on. In a certain sense, I too was a “killer” of my husband — essentially a good person. I did not value his qualities: loyalty, care, love.

The divorce did him good — he went through a lot, reconsidered much, changed — at over fifty years old! He even gave up his harmful habit.

At first, much in the lectures about family life seemed complicated. Then it began to sink in: there is karma, there is the psychology of man and woman, there is the reason why fate brings a man and a woman together.

I really liked this:
“A man and a woman come together in order to get rid of the very reason that brought them together — lust.”

It turns out that happiness is a spiritual concept. And a family needs a common goal in order to be happy — striving for God. And one must also tolerate a lot, a lot, so that the yajña is brought to completion.

Patience is the greatest austerity in family life, but the fruit of this austerity is kinship of souls — so desired and so hard to achieve. But this is already a very high level; it takes years and years…

In a very concise and very profound way, my spiritual teacher explains the conditions of a happy family life, the qualities required from husband and wife. Two from each:

The wife should be chaste and satisfied with what she has.
The husband should control his senses and take responsibility for the family’s well-being.

It seems simple and clear — until it concerns you personally. In our family, at least one of these qualities was missing in each of us — so the family did not work out.

But the most amazing thing is how powerful this many-sided science is. Everything works — even on the ruins of such a family as mine. Moreover, if you apply this knowledge in practice — even just try — the family is reborn literally from the ashes!

Not to argue with the husband and not to contradict him (let him speak).
To tolerate his presence and his habits (after all, once a year, when he comes on vacation, one can endure).
To feed him prasādam from morning till night.
To listen to his delirious stories about his journalism work and stupid bosses.
To praise his intelligence and abilities (what he has, he really has).
Not to impose Vaiṣṇava philosophy too straightforwardly (with a thin needle — journalists already know everything).
To be an unobtrusive example in spiritual practice.

Miracles happen right before your eyes!

When I went to Anapa for the festival, my husband took care of Tulasī. I don’t know what he said to her when he watered her, but I have never seen such big leaves on Tulasī Mahārāṇī in my life. When he left, she somehow became sad…

In one vacation alone he spends on us with our son more money than we saw in all twelve years of our married life. The atmosphere at home almost never becomes tense — except during football matches on TV.

This year he asked me to bring him beads from India — with the intention of fingering them to calm his mind. Then he asked for books explaining what to do with them. I sent him the Bhagavad-gītā and several others. Let him read…

I must say that my husband has always treated everything I do in Kṛṣṇa consciousness with respect. This is probably the fruit of some austerities of his. For an orthodox communist-Leninist, this is enormous spiritual progress. Apparently, even for communists, love is not an alien concept.

Our son is already twenty. He has some good qualities — from childhood. He never criticizes anyone; he simply can’t tolerate doing that. He will never humiliate anyone’s dignity or use people’s weaknesses for his own benefit. Cynicism is completely absent — I could barely explain to him what it is.

Of course, he is lazy and careless, but overall a good guy. He chanted japa for some time, then stopped.
“Mom, I already always think about God.”
All right. Everything in its own time.

I tried so that my son would never hear anything negative from me about his father. I read in some book that if you tell a son that his father is such-and-such, he will grow up to be a man with the same set of qualities — as if in revenge for his fatherlessness.

But he grew up knowing that he has a father, that they love each other, that they have complete mutual understanding.
“My dad will do anything for me!” — he is deeply convinced of that. And it is true. His father’s opinion is more important to him than mine — and that makes me happy.

The English have a saying: “Don’t raise your children — they’ll grow up like you anyway.” In this sense, I have a good incentive to advance in my spiritual life.

If my husband also became a devotee, I would probably marry him again — to serve a pure devotee. Such are my selfish interests. But women are selfish by nature, right, Guru Mahārāja? They are weak, helpless, and if they are not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then also unprotected. (Especially when they exaggerate their weaknesses.)

According to my horoscope, family life is contraindicated for me. But still I will say: “Being married is good.”

Family is wonderful. It is the natural environment for life. Good children can grow only in a good family. Of course, it is work that lasts a lifetime — but nobody said it would be easy!

Remember how our relatives cried at the wedding, wishing us a happy family life? Man by nature is a spiritual being, and ideally spiritual life should be natural for him. Therefore family life and spiritual life combine quite naturally.

What is so difficult here? Put an altar at home. A flower, a leaf, a fruit, and some water can always be found — and offer them with love to the One who created all this. Changes in the heart will begin, even though outwardly life will seem the same. Tested.

One feels like saying: “Being married is good, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness — better.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda created a big family for us. There is a place here for everyone — single people, divorced, families with many children, widows, young and not so young. Māta-jīs will never be lonely in old age — their home is always full of guests; everyone needs their care, their participation, their life experience. So much work has already been done — and so much still lies ahead!

“Preach, and you will be able to solve all your problems — personal and any others.” This is a phrase from a lecture of my teacher. And he gives examples of how preaching changes the lives of the preachers themselves.

The nature of a human being is to love. Why not direct all our inexhaustible love — if not to God, then at least to His devotees? There are so few of them on the planet — like little diamonds. Are they not worthy of our love? Everyone lacks love.

And if you are lucky enough to meet a Spiritual Master, in your relationship with him all sleeping feelings will awaken — feelings whose existence you might not even have suspected. Love like to a father, like to a teacher, maternal love, tenderness, longing, pain of separation, fear of losing him.

Not only māta-jīs — I know prabhus who love their spiritual masters very much, who treat them very tenderly and reverently.

…Sad as it is, children grow up and leave us; they want to live their own lives, just as we once did. We all remain alone in this world anyway. It would be better not to become so tightly attached to our relatives, so that later we do not tear them away from our hearts with blood and pain. Better to become attached like that to God…

If Kṛṣṇa is in the heart, we will never be alone. Kṛṣṇa is our best friend and well-wisher. God will not betray and will not abandon us — and this is the best thing in our life.


### (Letter)

I will try to write about our family life, but this will be a view from my side.

We have been together for eighteen years. If I look back, I am already a completely different person.

Like in most cases, probably, after we got married and started living together, disappointment set in. Especially for my husband. We quarreled, and since I was a girl with a strong character, the conflict could last for weeks. I would sulk and wanted to “teach him a lesson” so that next time he wouldn’t dare behave like that with me. But since my husband learned “lessons” poorly, the quarrels continued.

We studied in the same institute and also ran a business, that is, we spent almost all our time together — which did not strengthen our relationship. And then we understood: if we want to stay together, we need to live separately for some time. This turned out to be good for me. I realized that I have a wonderful husband.

I once heard that one of the stages of the development of love is friendship. We are exactly at this stage. We do not make claims against each other. There are no words like “you must” or “you are obliged” in our vocabulary. I realized that it is stupid to demand from a husband what is not in his nature.

When dissatisfaction accumulates in me, I say that we need to talk. We sit down, and I speak out. If he does not agree, we look for a compromise. If he says that he will try to do what I ask, I calm down. And I know that in the best case he will try once, in the worst case he will forget our conversation in five minutes. But I like that at least for one minute he showed the desire to try, so I do not make any claims against him.

My husband has a very good sense of humor. I think our marriage holds together because of it. We are constantly teasing each other. We joke and laugh a lot.

Sometimes I ask serious questions, and he doesn’t feel like answering them. There are questions that men are afraid to answer, because they don’t know what reaction the woman will have to any possible answer. But they know for sure that whatever they answer will be wrong. So they start to dodge in a funny way. And usually they pretend they didn’t hear.

I noticed this not only in our family, but in other couples too. I even asked Vraja whether they are specially taught this. He pretends not to hear, or starts acting silly, says some nonsense, and I start laughing.

There is also such a nuance: women do not accept jokes about their appearance, or when someone says they are not loved. So when he starts telling me something like that, even jokingly, I have a double reaction: I laugh, but at the same time I am dissatisfied. He continues, I laugh even more, but the dissatisfaction grows too. From laughing I already can’t speak, but until I hear a compliment, I won’t leave him alone. That’s the kind of “horror” we have in our family.

By nature my husband is very calm, and after living so long with him, I discovered that my own character has changed too. Now I don’t stay offended longer than ten minutes. In arguments I don’t try to prove that I am right. Before, I fought to the very end, but then I noticed that even when I won, I didn’t feel happy. To give in does not mean to lose.

We argue rarely. I know it’s useless. If my husband cannot choose between two things or decide on a color, he asks me what I would advise him. And he обязательно does the opposite. I like this very much, because before answering I try to guess what he himself wants. I have never guessed right.

When we bought a carpet, we couldn’t decide how to lay it. He suggested lengthwise, I crosswise. We didn’t argue. Entering the room, each of us would turn it our own way. I remember we laughed a lot, because we deliberately tried to go into the room more often to check how the carpet was lying and quietly turn it over. Now it lies the way my husband wanted.

Every day I tell him compliments: how wonderful he is, handsome, smart, and so on. He shows me his fist and squints with pleasure, and I also get pleasure from it.

I also understood how important it is to show that they are needed by us.

We had an interesting story. My husband likes to sit at the computer, he understands them well, and once something wasn’t working out for him. He spent a lot of time and was already starting to get upset that nothing was working. I came up and said that everything would work out for him, because he understands this stuff perfectly and he is so smart.

After some time he peeked into the room and said that everything worked out. I replied that I had no doubt about it.

A month or more later he had difficulties again. This time I didn’t say anything, I was busy with something. He came up and started complaining that it wasn’t working. I didn’t understand the hint and continued to nod sympathetically. Then he asked me to say that everything would work out for him. I said it — and it worked out. Now we always do it this way.

It is very important to support and inspire, to let them understand that they are believed in.

I also say that I am proud of him. And it’s true.

I am also grateful to him for his patience. I asked him what he is grateful to me for. He said: for three meals a day and for his growing belly.

That’s how we talk.


### (Letter)

Our family already had some life experience, and we were expecting our third child when the first books of Prabhupāda appeared in our home. My husband devoted all his free time to reading them. Coming home from work, he would plunge into them completely, as if into another world.

Seeing such interest, I tried to disturb him less and took almost all the household work upon myself. At that time we lived in a private house: it was necessary to heat and clean the stove, carry water from the pump, clear snow in the yard, bring coal and firewood. These used to be his duties; I took care only of the children. Before, he even helped me cook and wash. But when the books appeared, he no longer had time for that. His interest was so strong that I felt sorry to distract him.

I myself had no time to read; I only looked at the pictures — that was my first acquaintance with the books. Seeing how busy I was, my husband began to tell me himself what these books were about. So I learned that the soul is immortal, that there is a cycle of birth and death, that we are not the body — and many other things. If I didn’t understand something, he would say: “Read it on such-and-such a page, I underlined it for you.” And I would read.

I consider my first book in Krishna consciousness to be *The Higher Taste* / *The Art of Vedic Cooking* (Vedic Culinary Art). He gave it to me on March 8. And for a long time he couldn’t wait for me to start cooking from it. I took this book seriously and studied it literally chapter by chapter. And then, after a general cleaning of the kitchen and preparing all the necessary utensils, when I finally began to cook prasādam, I was fortunate to experience amazing, new feelings that are difficult to explain or put into words. It was happiness. I cannot convey it. What happiness it is to be in Krishna consciousness!

When our youngest son was a few months old, my husband said to me: “You need to go to one place. There will be a festival there.” And he gave me the address of the temple and explained how to get there, and he himself stayed with the children. That’s how I met the devotees.

Later we went as a whole family — even with the baby in a stroller — to harināmas, Sunday programs and festivals, and we carried out various services given by senior devotees. I participated in different plays for the festivals together with the children; my husband took part in building the pandal in the temple courtyard, and later made lighting for the evening programs.

At home we arranged small kīrtanas: we sat in a circle, father would start singing, and we and the children would repeat after him. Thus Krishna entered our home.

My husband has very many good qualities. It seems to me that he is made entirely of достоинства — good qualities. And although he himself does not consider himself a devotee, because he rarely goes to the temple and does not associate much with devotees, for me he is the closest mentor and the senior devotee.

For many years he has strictly followed his sādhana: early rising, guru’s lectures, sixteen rounds, reading Prabhupāda’s books. He alone supports the material well-being of our large family, giving me the opportunity to engage in devotional service in the Society for Krishna Consciousness, to take care of the household and raise the children.

He is an attentive and caring son — we live together with his mother. A wise and strict father, a loving and demanding husband. I try to live up to him, although sometimes I get offended and argue, but he has enough tact and patience to explain things to me.

By his behavior and way of life, by the fact that for many years he has followed the regulative principles given by Prabhupāda, he inspires us to walk this path as well.

This is what a happy family life is — one that is possible only in Krishna consciousness. Now I cannot imagine how our relationship would have developed without Krishna consciousness and the devotees, without service and without a single goal and meaning in life.


### (Letter)

Before Krishna consciousness, to be honest, there was not much joy in our family life, except that we had three children. But they grew up and became adults. Probably that is why we came here, to the Movement — because we had reached a dead end, both in our relationship with each other and in our relationships with the children.

The essence is that when you do not know the laws by which you should live, there can be no happiness. Each of us considered only ourselves to be right: I was pulling in my direction, my husband in his, and neither of us was satisfied. But we were fortunate — we met the devotees and attended lectures by Audarya Dhama Prabhu (Oleg Torsunov).

The first and most significant thing for our future was that all of us at the same time gave up killing food (meat). And gradually our consciousness began to become purified, and we were able to accept the rules and regulations of Vedic philosophy and culture as our way of life.

The fact that our elder son lived for quite a long time in the Moscow temple, studied philosophy and practiced spiritual life, I very much hope laid the foundation for his future — the right direction for the rest of his life. The same applies to our younger son, who lived for two months in the Ivanovo gurukula. That is, our children share with us the path and the principles that we have taken as the basis of our life. Now all of us together try to follow them.

The benefit of family life is that when people live very closely together, they learn patience, humility, and love at the same time. The knowledge given by Srila Prabhupada helps in this. Even in what concerns sexual relations, this gradually faded into the background. Thus we attained more elevated and deeper relationships with each other. And all this is thanks to the fact that for seven years we practiced together with my husband. We went together to educational programs at the temple, and at home we held nama-hattas and served the devotees, and together we solved all problems.

In my husband I greatly value his devotion to the family, his faithfulness, and his strong intelligence. Because we are working on ourselves, trying to change — both of us, making efforts — our relationship is constantly improving. This helps us respect and appreciate each other even more. We know: if you yourself do not change, the problems do not go away.

I understood very well that I should not bring anxiety to anyone at all, and now I try to live in this way. And now we see results that inspire both of us.

It seems that we hardly have any misfortunes or difficulties anymore. We try to accept all situations as lessons of life and lessons from Krishna. What does He want to tell us?! And our joys consist in this: when we overcome some negative qualities in ourselves, when we can bring our senses under control, we see that for each member of the family this itself is joy. And when there are good emotions, you try to express them as much as possible, to share them with everyone.

Before, it was difficult to rejoice in someone else’s happiness and difficult not to rejoice at someone else’s misfortune. And even in relation to children sometimes it would slip through — we, the older ones, envy the young; we do not know how to rejoice for them with full strength. Even toward one’s own children there can be envy. Or when, for example, a child turns out to be wrong, a mother or father may shout irritably: “I told you so… I was right…” Or another moment: when children irritate you by being different from you in something. You think he should be one way, and he turns out to be completely different. We too were guilty of all this.

But to learn to rejoice precisely in a person’s uniqueness, in his individuality — that is difficult. That is possible only thanks to knowledge, only with God. Because that is Krishna consciousness — to accept and value everyone as they are, because Krishna Himself accepts them as they are. Now we all try to see in each other and around us only the good, and not to notice the bad — to develop the vision of the bee, as the Vedas teach us. It is joyful and pleasant to watch each other’s successes.

I feel true joy for my children — for the fact that they are making the right choices in life and becoming successful. That they are not standing in back alleys and stairwells with idle youth, not drinking alcohol. This does not interest them at all, because they already have a higher taste and good association.

I am also very happy for our granddaughter — for the fact that even before her birth she was able to go through purificatory rites. That from infancy she could hear the sound of the Holy Name. And the word “Krishna” was one of her first words. When we turned off the music with the Hare Krishna mantra, she would loudly declare: “I Krishna,” meaning: give Him back, turn it on again. The same if she needed the book from the shelf with pictures of Krishna — Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam became one of the child’s first favorite books. Now she is two and a half years old, and she is already trying to repeat the Holy Name on beads, watching the elders.

I feel great gratitude to my husband and children for the fact that we had no contradictions among ourselves in accepting Krishna consciousness, this new way of life and way of thinking, and in beginning to act as a whole family in accordance with the new knowledge. I did not have to spend any effort convincing any of my family members. We also did not have any fanaticism or desire to quickly obtain spiritual results. We walked and continue to walk gradually.

We continue spiritual practice, realizing that it is impossible to become saints all at once. Of course, there are temptations, but consciousness does not change so quickly, and efforts should not be connected with performing rituals well, but with working on one’s personal qualities through a responsible attitude to one’s duties toward family and other people.

Our activity is connected with partner-based business. This also helps to form qualities, and those people who become our business partners, entering our family circle, begin to copy our way of life. New devotee families appear around us. When we achieved certain results in business, people became interested in how we achieved this. And when we share our experience, we can openly and sincerely preach Krishna consciousness. And people accept it well, because they see the result — our material well-being, which we achieved thanks to the spiritual practice of Krishna consciousness.

There is satisfaction in all spheres of life thanks to such a way of life and the common goal of our whole family.


### (Letter)

How many times, watching my husband chant japa, I have thought: what a happiness it is that the Lord gave me exactly such a husband — reliable, responsible, strong, and at the same time responsive and very attentive to my needs. But it was not always like this. I know for sure: if it were not for Krishna consciousness, our family would have fallen apart — and entirely because of me.

Like a spoiled princess from the fairy tale *The Swineherd*, proud and arrogant, I took the care and attention of my prabhu as something completely natural. All one could hear was: “I want this, I want that, I want, I want, I want.” And Misha, at the cost of incredible efforts, had to spin like a squirrel in a wheel to bring joy to his “little ant” — that’s what he calls me. But I was not a little ant — I was a monster, ready to burn with my glance both him and all his relatives, everyone who prevented me from enjoying this life and who did not give due honor to my “great” person. Where he found so much patience, I cannot imagine. Probably this is what self-giving love is — the kind that endures everything and overcomes everything.

With this “crown” on my head I entered the society of devotees, trying very hard not to drop it. Only thanks to the kindness, patience, and good words of the people I met on the path of devotional service, only thanks to the mercy of the Holy Name and the patience of my mentor Vamshidhara Prabhu, I voluntarily gave up my “royalty.”

You cannot imagine with what joy I began to wash and iron my husband’s shirts, to invent something tasty for my beloved. I learned to smile and to rejoice in what we have. And, most importantly, our children — our daughter and son — are with us in this. With what great pleasure Sofya and Valikhan take part in performances for the devotees! They are not just actors, but also active co-authors, helping me bring ideas of devotional service to life. My prabhu does not yet take part in the performances, but I think it is only a matter of time — he has more than enough imagination and humor.

I am happy that my daughter is fond of Indian dance, which helped her develop flexibility and smoothness of movement, femininity and gentleness. And yet once she had been refused admission to a school dance club as “unpromising” and clumsy. This is how devotees differ from others: they see in a person something more than just the outer shell. Vedic knowledge, the chanting of the Holy Names, and prasadam do their work — the heart becomes softer, the gaze kinder. And how could it not become kinder, if to the two existing eyes a “third” is added, allowing one to see in a person all the beautiful and bright things that Krishna has placed in him?

It was not easy for my husband, working in law enforcement structures, to carry the wisdom of the Vedas to those for whom rudeness, boorishness, alcohol, and violence are a natural part of their, albeit difficult, but already habitual — and therefore unhappy — life. And yet, surprisingly, among both his colleagues and the prisoners there were those who believed him, who behind his imposing appearance saw not just a man with inner strength, intelligence, and compassion, but someone who can give a real answer to the questions “What should be done?” and “Who is to blame?”

Criticism, misunderstanding, and mockery are now in the past. Faith in Krishna, the Holy Name, and association with devotees give a person wings, give him strength and determination to go this path to the end. People around see this and pay their respect to the one who was able to renounce many temptations of this life. Misha managed — they have not yet. Yet. But the work continues.

A wife in the family should understand that the path of a man who has chosen devotional service is thorny and unpredictable. How he wants, coming home, to see kind and gentle faces of his wife and children, to honor prasadam, to glance around a clean and cozy home. He will rest, reflect on the impressions of the day, think about his mistakes. And tomorrow — again into battle: with maya, lust, envy, and false ego. He needs a rear support — very reliable and very strong. A blow in the back can be fatal — a man can break.

Therefore, hide your anger, resentments, and reproaches in some box and do not let them out under any circumstances. This “Pandora’s box” will surely disappear. Just do not give up japa, do not give up devotional service. And one fine day you will feel that in this whole wide world there is nothing more important than kind and deep relationships, the Holy Name, and the association of devotees.

**WIFE:**

Our family was created not long ago, but it is not exactly a “young” family. Behind us is a certain life experience, many different situations that cannot be called average or ordinary. At the time we created our family, we were thirty-five and forty, and two already fairly grown children “appeared” at once: a daughter of fifteen and a son of eleven. But in our view, none of this hinders our development. On the contrary, we see in this certain advantages: there is favorable ground for learning humility, patience, and other Vaishnava qualities.

**HUSBAND:**

In 1994 I joined the Krishna Consciousness movement, and very soon moved into the temple and began to live the life of a brahmacari. A few years later, senior devotees recommended that I change my ashram. And since before that I had no experience of family life, I began to take interest in the essence of the grihastha-ashram and the duties I would have to fulfill. From my spiritual teacher I learned that a person who plans to become a householder should clearly understand where he will live, how he will earn money to support the family, and what practical devotional service he will perform. I had enough practical service, while housing and income were a problem.

Gradually the emphasis in my service shifted toward deepening relationships with devotees rather than intense external activity. As a nama-hatta leader I acquired dependents, and experience in caring for devotees began to appear.

The years went by. Some matajis made “proposals” to me, and this caused quite a bit of disturbance in my spiritual life and interfered with my duties as an instructor. This eventually prompted me to take the idea of taking shelter in the grihastha-ashram more seriously.

A few years later, when material issues began to be resolved and the possibility of stable income appeared, I managed to attend the first instructors’ festival in Volgograd. There, through association with experienced devotees, some aspects of family life became clearer to me.

A couple of months later I had the good fortune to speak with my mentor. I laid out all my doubts and fears about making such a responsible decision and asked him to give me criteria for choosing a wife. He said that indecision and fear force one to make the worst possible choice in a situation, and that the criteria are simple: the chosen woman should be pleasing to one’s heart, not imposed by someone else; and she should have a genuine desire to serve. In the end, everyone must bear responsibility for his own decision.

After thinking over his answer and analyzing different possibilities, a couple of weeks later I made a proposal to one mataji.

**WIFE:**

Before meeting the devotees I had a family and two children. But because there was no common goal in life and no mutuality, we had to part. I worked and raised the children, trying to support myself materially and spiritually, drawing joy from association with devotees and from service. A great role in that period of my life was played by my spiritual teacher, by his love and compassion.

Reflecting on my situation, I tried to focus more on fulfilling my duties and working on my qualities, and always tried to be grateful to the Lord for the opportunity to learn and move forward. Understanding that it is very difficult to do this alone, I never abandoned the thought that it is precisely in marriage that a woman can realize herself fully, serving her husband and God. Knowing my future husband for several years, I accepted his proposal to create a family.

**HUSBAND:**

Devotees played an enormous role in the creation of our family. Many, from seniors to newcomers, blessed us and gave us their good wishes. After the engagement, we began holding nama-hattas. We like to receive devotees, to treat them to prasadam, to see their joy from association and from chanting together.

**WIFE:**

I am convinced that every family in Krishna consciousness should receive guests. This protects one from the danger of becoming closed in on each other and isolated from the society of devotees. Every reception of guests revives spiritual life and reminds us of the highest goal.

**HUSBAND:**

Our union had a благотворный (beneficial) effect on our relationships with relatives. By fulfilling their wishes, we received their support and approval. Our relationships with them became much warmer and more natural. Now, in their eyes, we are full-fledged members of society.

**WIFE:**

Our common difficulties lie in how to properly build relationships with the children. It is important for both of us to learn to do this out of love, without expecting a reward in the form of their complete conformity to our expectations. Every child is “complicated” in his or her own way. But these difficulties teach us to take into account not only our own interests, and to look at the world not only through our own eyes.

**HUSBAND:**

After our decision to live together, we began to clarify each other’s expectations. My wife said that in family life relationships should be the priority, not money, and that she agrees to be content with the level of comfort that will come without excessive effort. And I am grateful to her that this did not remain just words.

**WIFE:**

I am very grateful to my husband for his sensitivity and attentiveness to all of us, for his reliability and responsibility. He knows how to care, is patient and indulgent toward the “imperfections” of others. I always count on his understanding, on the fact that he will simply give me time and listen to me. His sincerity, generosity of heart, and wisdom inspire me greatly.

I like that whatever misunderstandings may arise, we can always calmly discuss our views. We do not put them off “for later,” whatever the issue. One must learn to convey them properly to one’s spouse — without reproaches and hasty judgments. Krishna helps devotees. He, as the best friend and psychologist, teaches attentiveness to one another and gives understanding of how to get out of any, even the most difficult, situations.

**HUSBAND:**

I am grateful to my wife for humbly accepting and sharing with me my functions as an instructor: part of the communication now falls on her. I also see in her a friend with whom I can discuss all spiritual topics related to Krishna. She approaches her duties as wife and mother very responsibly. These qualities of hers — responsibility and steadiness — attract me very much.

All everyday problems have disappeared for me: when I come home from work, I find domestic comfort, tasty prasadam, and my wife’s contentment. Her care, responsiveness, and sensitivity inspire me. She was a happy person even before our marriage and is happy now. I advise young people to make their choice in favor of happy people in Krishna consciousness.

Our future… it lies in the fact that we want to spread our happiness to everyone else — devotees and non-devotees. And this is a very joyful prospect for us.

**Hare Krishna!**


### (Letter)


I have only a small amount of experience of life in the grihastha-ashram, because an ashram is a place for spiritual development. Before coming to the Movement, I had an unfortunate family experience and had been married twice. Both marriages ended in divorce, because the relationships were built on egoism on both sides. I take a large part of the blame upon myself, because as the head of the family it was precisely I who should have been the guide for my loved ones. But instead I followed my own feelings and desires, and demanded and obtained everything that I personally wanted.

I was already divorced once again when I came to the Society for Krishna Consciousness, and I decided that if I were ever to marry, my wife must be not only outwardly attractive, but inwardly attractive as well — that is, religious, humble, and so on. For the first time in my life I asked Krishna for this, and literally a few months later I happened to meet the woman of my dreams. In the very first hours of our acquaintance I poured out to her the whole philosophy of Krishna consciousness, told her about Srila Prabhupada and Vedic culture. This made a great impression on her, and soon we were married.

She had her own family experience as well — she too was divorced and had two children. She was born and raised in a genuinely Christian family and from the age of ten traveled with her mother to monasteries around the country, living in them for several months at a time and becoming accustomed to ascetic monastic life. By the age of seventeen she had decided to enter a monastery and dedicate herself completely to serving God. But her spiritual mentor told her that she was not yet ready for that, that first she should finish university, and then — time would tell. By the age of twenty she had already formed clear ideas about life, its meaning, and had developed corresponding qualities.

When we met, after our very first conversations and meetings she confessed to me that she had always wanted to be married to a person who wants to live with God. On her first visit to our Temple she was in a state of euphoria from joy and great inspiration from everything she saw and heard there. That same day japa beads were bought, and she joyfully began to chant the mantra, easily accepting all the principles of Krishna consciousness.

And to this day we try to build our family life on the principles of the grihastha-ashram. On a free evening we gather the whole family at the altar and sing the evening service; then we sit in a circle, take turns leading kirtana, read something from the shastras, or I tell them about Krishna, about the Holy Dham. I always give the boys an opportunity to express their understanding of the nature of the soul and God, of our relationship with Him, or sometimes we watch video programs and films reflecting spiritual themes.

In every way I try to awaken in them a taste for a pure, meaningful, and spiritualized life. It does not always work, because they are not my biological children and often communicate with their father, who in every possible way sets them against what I am trying to instill in them. But I do not want to put any pressure on them — especially at their age this should by no means be done, because it can bring a sectarian mentality into their minds. My wife and I do not lose heart — everything is still ahead, and I think that in the future they will appreciate our example.

Life in the grihastha-ashram is responsibility for one another and for the children before God and society, where the main criterion is service to Krishna.

Society should be organized in such a way that spiritual knowledge develops, along with elevated and pious qualities in leaders and in all people of every social level and background.

Once I had an experience like this. I came to the Holy Dham, knowing in advance that my Guru Maharaj and my spiritual brothers and sisters would also come there. We all met very warmly, but in the course of association and service to our Gurudeva, some matajis began to bother me with endless remarks and criticisms. I remembered my wife, who during all the years of our life together has never criticized me or spoken sarcastically to me. Therefore, at the beginning of my relationships with my God-sisters I tried not to react to their criticism and maintained soft and friendly relations. But once, in response to yet another remark, I decided to react by telling them about my wonderful wife, about her Vaishnava qualities, and about how I learn humility and patience from her. I also said that if they were so concerned about my spiritual life, they should, according to etiquette, approach my wife and point out my shortcomings to her.

My sisters became embarrassed and also noted the humble qualities of my wife. After that incident I noticed that our relationships improved. In this way my wife protected me, for which I am endlessly grateful to her.

Analyzing the situation, I understood that I myself had been at fault in many ways, because in relationships between prabhus and matajis — especially unmarried or divorced ones — one should not allow familiarity. It is necessary to keep a certain distance and address one another formally, thereby emphasizing mutual respect, appreciating and glorifying the best qualities in each other, rather than inflating minor faults into storms and becoming a “fly” engaged in prajalpa (idle talk).

As for the grihastha-ashram, it is a constant process of developing spiritual knowledge, in which material desires are not the main or dominant goal of family life. Such is my realization of family life.


### (Letter)


Before we get married, I want to tell you the following:

1. You are the wife, and I am the husband. Not the other way around.
2. You should be engaged in active work — either at home or at a job.
3. During the “trial period,” that is, six months, I will give you $100 per month for your personal expenses. Over the last 2–3 months you spent about $1000. In the future I would not like to hear any demands from you for money or purchases — I myself would like to decide what to buy for you.
4. Prasad will have to be cooked twice a day, and you should not complain about it.
5. I cannot tell you now where we will live. Maybe with my parents, maybe I will rent an apartment, maybe at the dacha, or maybe I will buy an apartment; maybe I will travel and we will not have a fixed place of residence — or maybe all these options will alternate. Under all circumstances I do not want to hear complaints from you about living conditions.

And most importantly — do not gossip behind my back! And do not tell everyone about your problems with me! Do not take the trash out of the house!


In general, I am very lucky to have met you in my life, and that you took upon yourself the responsibility to associate with me and live with me. I like the idea of a “marriage agreement.” Especially the clause about $100 for personal expenses. Many could envy that, especially the matajis in the temple who have $10 a month.

I agree with you that we should not rush into marriage and having a child. About housing: of course, I would like to live with you in a separate apartment, but as I understand, we do not always get what we want. Therefore, I agree to your conditions, as long as I can be near you. I promise not to complain. I do not mind traveling. In general, I accept all your conditions and want to state mine:

1. If you are the husband and I am the wife, then I want you to be interested in our spiritual life — that is, to personally follow the vows given to the spiritual master and to demand this from me as well. I want to resume Deity worship, and I want you not to be indifferent to this. I want us both to rise early and follow the spiritual program. I am now in the mode of ignorance, and I hope that you will help me get out of it.
2. I never want to hear reproaches like: “It’s your fault that I don’t chant my mantra, that I don’t earn money.” This hurts me very much, because you know on whom this depends. I want you always to be a leader for me, and for my part I will try to inspire you.
3. Mutual trust and fidelity. If we live together and consider ourselves husband and wife, then let there be no outside relationships or phone calls. If there is any correspondence, we both should know about it.


We help each other develop a spirit of service to Krishna by organizing nama-hattas. Before, we forgot that at home we are also devotees, and behaved egoistically toward one another. It was difficult to understand that the development of proper relationships was being obstructed by the fact that I did not feel support from my beloved wife — she was not chanting the mantra. It was very hard, both for me and for my wife.

On the eve of the New Year a family rebellion occurred, and then calm set in. The chanting of the Holy Name saved us. Anya began to chant the maha-mantra again.

There was a reassessment of values, and a new understanding of our position in this world and toward each other opened up.

Now we live in peace and harmony, try to serve Krishna, and learn to fulfill our duties.

Once our spiritual teacher gave a definition of the word “enjoyment,” and now this is our compass in relationships: if we do not quarrel, it means we have properly fulfilled our duties.

We treat our friends, acquaintances, and even strangers with prasad.

We try to maintain sattva-guna in the house, and I wash the floor in the apartment after sleeping. And my wife also washes the stairwell and fumigates the entrance with maha-prasadam incense sticks. On our altar lives Radha-kunda, and every morning we perform a small puja to the altar.

We often joke and laugh together. We have a joke that in the spiritual world I will be a tree stump, and my wife will be the moss on me, and someday Krishna will sit on it — and it will be soft for Him to sit.

**HE:**

After mangala-arati, as usual, I went outside and was preparing to go to my service (I had to go fetch bricks for the construction of the temple). A young mataji from the ashram called out to me and said that she agreed to marry me. I was stunned by such an unexpected proposal, because I had not been thinking about marriage at all.

In response to her proposal I objected:
“Mataji, are you sure you are doing the right thing, approaching me, a brahmachari?”

Of course, I had seen this girl many times and had heard that she did a lot of service, making delicious cakes and pastries for the devotees and for the sponsors who were helping with the temple construction. I worked in the kitchen and distributed prasadam to the devotees and the builders, and sometimes, usually after everyone else, she also came for prasadam.

I was surprised: why had she chosen precisely me, since at that time there were many other enthusiastic devotees? I asked: “Why me?” In reply I heard that I was an enthusiastic devotee who listens to the opinion of his spiritual mentor.

I became curious: “Mataji, do you understand what this smells like?” It seems that I asked this question to myself as well. Mataji replied that she had weighed everything very carefully before approaching me. We agreed that in three days I would give an answer.

Because I was under the impression of that morning, I brought bricks that matched my consciousness (of different colors).

Later I remembered a confidential conversation with my spiritual mentor that had taken place nine months earlier. I had complained to him that I had lost my former enthusiasm in devotional service, although I was still strictly following sadhana-bhakti and was fully engaged in service in the construction of our temple.

During that conversation my leader, to my surprise, tried to explain to me that there are several ways in which devotees, depending on their desires, can develop.

The first path is when a person, without receiving proper education in the society of devotees, tries to arrange his life on his own, gets married, and so on — and later suffers greatly.

The second is when, having come into the society of devotees, he receives proper education, gets married, and lives happily in Krishna consciousness.

The third is when, having attained spiritual qualification, he begins to perceive the whole world as his large family.

Then the mentor asked me which path I would choose. I answered that I did not want to follow the first, but I was afraid that I would not be able to walk the third. Then the leader offered to take care of me in this regard, if I would be truthful. I agreed.

After that conversation my despondency disappeared as if licked away by a cow’s tongue.

To be honest, I wasn’t even thinking about getting married, but I remember that I was completely immersed in service, and in the summer I even organized harinamas in the city center. After the mataji’s proposal I approached my mentor to make sure of his involvement in what had happened, and he said: “Think and decide for yourself.”


**SHE:**

The three days dragged on forever. My false ego was hurt, and I was preparing to leave the city for a while. Finally he came and gave his consent.

That same day I went to my parents and told them that I was getting married. My mother asked how old he was and what his name was, but I didn’t know anything. The next day we announced our engagement. There we found out each other’s ages and our karmic names. I was glad that my future husband was three years older than me, just as I wanted.

A few days later I went with a group of devotees to the Vyasa-puja of my Guru Maharaja. My fiancé also went there to ask for blessings from my Guru Maharaja. Guru Maharaja looked at us attentively and wished us good luck. I was very surprised by this wish and for a long time could not understand what Guru Maharaja meant. Studying the *Srimad-Bhagavatam*, I finally understood that when a Vaishnava wishes “good luck,” it means to be able to develop pure devotion and love for God.

Also, Guru Maharaja explained in a lecture what etiquette should be observed between husband and wife: when the wife is cooking, the husband should relate to her like to his mother; when the husband and wife are in society, the husband should look at his wife as a friend; when alone — as his beloved.


**HE:**

After the engagement was announced, I asked my spiritual leader about the service I could perform in the grihastha-ashram. The service he proposed to me seemed unusual — I had never seen myself in that role.


**SHE:**

After getting married I realized that for a girl it is great fortune to marry a devotee. After marriage I became whole; I received greater opportunities in preaching. My relationships with my parents became very good. My mind became so calm that it became easy for me to read Srila Prabhupada’s books and chant japa. During congregational chanting and discussions at programs I concentrate easily and do not get distracted. Of course, I still have to work a lot on myself.

At first we often stayed at my husband’s parents’ place (they live very harmoniously), and I observed how his mother relates to his father, because since childhood I had not had such an example. From ashram life there remained the habit of deciding everything myself, being independent, and this interfered with healthy family relationships.

I saw that the inner relationships in the family depend more on me, on my purity. If I become greedy and do not want to see anyone in our home, then my husband wants my company less. I understood that if many guests come to our home, I cook nicely, watch my consciousness by studying *Srimad-Bhagavatam* and discussing it with my husband, and try to be in the role of mother, wife, and friend, then our family becomes strong. Only then are we able to help other people, and peace and tranquility come to my heart.

Marriage in Krishna consciousness is the best and most natural preaching for me.

My husband remains a mystery to me. By nature I love solitude and not standing out anywhere. My husband’s nature is the opposite: he loves people, loves to care for them, to sing and play the accordion at harinamas, and to walk in dhoti. Thanks to this, I am never bored. Although I have to make quite a bit of effort to support his desires, deep in my heart I realize that with such a husband I will never be overcome by the boredom and emptiness that haunted me for the first 15 years of my life.

I value the kindness and respect that my husband shows me. Whatever difficulties arise, I try to seek shelter in *Srimad-Bhagavatam*. In fact, this person has become closer to me than just a husband — he helps me be engaged in the mission of Lord Chaitanya’s sankirtana. This person has been given to me by Krishna.


**HE:**

My relationships with my parents improved greatly after marriage.

The first years of family life were difficult for me, because one has to maintain one’s spiritual level by oneself. Living in the ashram is easy: everyone gets up — and you get up; everyone chants — and you chant; everyone goes to sleep — and you go to sleep; the whole day is occupied with selfless devotional service.

I am very grateful for the support of my spiritual leader and for the service he gave me. He gave me service according to my inclinations, paid for my studies at the university, patiently waited and continues to wait until I am ready to accept corrections in my spiritual life. He taught me to depend, in the best case, on Krishna, and in the worst case, on the devotees. You accepted me as a shiksha disciple and allowed me to come closer to you; out of respect for you, I gave up the television.

Family life is a tight knot, but by serving the spiritual mentors even a lame man can cross mountains. From the very beginning of our family life you indicated that the guide of family life is the daily discussion of *Srimad-Bhagavatam*. This protected us from all kinds of problems that occur in families. Following this instruction allows us to feel that we are not in grihamedha life, but in the grihastha-ashram.


Perfect. We’ll aim for a **middle register**:

* Serious, spiritual, book-quality English
* Not archaic, not slangy
* Clear, sober, readable for modern Western devotees
* Faithful in meaning, structure, and argument
* With **only soft harmonization**, not rewriting

Let’s begin.


### **THE TRUTH ABOUT FAMILY LIFE**

I have been practicing bhakti-yoga for about fifteen years. I am a family man and have been living family life for the last nine years. My story will not be a pleasant one, so I do not wish to mention my name or the names of anyone else. I am not seeking any unnecessary attention. Those who know me well will easily recognize who is speaking. I ask the others not to speculate, because my story is quite typical and reflects the general condition of life in this material world, in this age of Kali.

I will present the material in such a way that the reader may feel as if a series of nails—axioms—are being driven into his head, which he is expected simply to accept.

I am a man, therefore my story is addressed primarily to men. But I am sure that this experience will also be useful for women. So, brace yourselves.


### **THE FIRST NAIL**

#### **FAMILY LIFE IS MEANT TO BRING DISILLUSIONMENT WITH MATERIAL EXISTENCE**

I never wanted to be a family man. It never even crossed my mind. I simply lived, striving for perfection. At a certain point in that search I came to bhakti-yoga and have remained here for about fifteen years already—almost half my life. Compared to everything I did before, bhakti-yoga has held my interest for an unusually long time, and my desire to succeed in this practice has not weakened, unlike my previous pursuits.

The goal of bhakti-yoga is liberation from the influence of the material world and the attainment of the highest perfection of life: restoring one’s relationship with God, the Supreme Absolute Truth, and returning to the spiritual world, where these relationships are full of variety and give rise to a stable state of happiness.

After several years of practice I felt a certain stagnation and began to look for ways to refresh my determination. My mentor told me that it was time to get married. This, he said, would help me become more deeply disillusioned with material existence. The relationship between man and woman is the foundation of material life and one of the main obstacles on the path to liberation.

I am a simple person, so without much overthinking I accepted this recommendation and began to look for a suitable candidate. I did not have to search for long, because when one knows the goal, the necessary means come without delay. Fate sent me a girl who, in all respects, was suitable for the purpose I had set before myself. She was attractive, similar to me in character and occupation, also practiced bhakti-yoga, and did so with the same aim—self-perfection. Moreover, she had not been spoiled by casual relationships with the opposite sex; I was her first man, which in our time is a great rarity.

I made her a proposal right away and, without receiving any clear consent, married her.

You may ask: how can one marry without consent? I will answer simply. A woman is not in a position to give or withhold consent, because this contradicts her nature. A woman needs protection, and therefore there is no need to wait until she asks for it. One should simply begin to protect her, and she will be grateful. That is why in traditional cultures girls are married at a young age, and the older a woman becomes, the more difficult it is to arrange this, because as an adult she has to make the decision herself—and that, as I have said, is almost impossible.

So, said and done. We got married. This happened two years after our engagement, only because I was inexperienced and acted indecisively. I kept asking for her consent and trying to persuade her. And she, as is typical for a woman, neither said yes nor no. Together with me, several of my mentors and spiritual teachers tried to persuade her, until finally I simply put her in the saddle and rode off toward the rising sun.

We began our family life “out of the blue,” knowing almost nothing about it. But if the goal is clear, the necessary experience will come. Remember this simple truth. In any undertaking it is important to set the right goal—or at least to set a goal at all—especially when you are striving for the highest goal of human life.


### **THE SECOND NAIL**

#### **THE MAIN GOAL OF FAMILY LIFE IS TO HAVE AS MUCH SEX AS POSSIBLE**

Do not deceive yourselves. If you are striving for the highest perfection (see the first paragraph of the First Nail), do not imagine that family life by itself will help you in this. During the first five years of my practice of bhakti-yoga I was trained as a strict novice monk, for whom even the thought of women and sex was unacceptable. All those years I did not associate with women, and if I did, it was only formally, without developing close relationships. I observed celibacy and did not lose my seed even in my sleep.

My spiritual teacher told me that sex is meant only for conceiving children, and therefore in family life one may engage in it only a few times, in order to have a few children. And if children are not needed, then there is no reason to have sex—and no reason to marry either.

With these strict instructions and a hope for the best, I entered family life. The truth turned out to be bitter and staggering. In the very first week of our life together, my young wife and I exceeded all the “allowed limits” for the sake of having children. For me this was a severe trial. My spiritual life was at stake, and the highest goal was under threat.

I will explain why. Several years earlier I had received initiation into the practice of bhakti-yoga from my spiritual teacher and had promised him not to engage in illicit sex, and in marriage—only for the conception of children. Imagine the depth of my disappointment when I was faced with the fact that I could not keep this promise. I do not know about you, but for me breaking a promise is a very serious fault. And here this misfortune: the promise ceased to be kept from the very first day of family life.

I was so crushed by this that I seriously decided to end my life. This is not a joke or bravado. It was truly a great tragedy for me, from which I did not see a way out.

What saved me from such a reckless step was spiritual knowledge. According to the Vedic conception of the universe, there is a specific law of nature concerning suicide. Suicide is considered a great crime. One who voluntarily leaves his life is given the body of a ghost, in which he suffers for a long time. And since my goal is to attain the highest perfection, existence in a ghostly body did not fit very well with achieving that goal quickly. I decided not to settle accounts with life, but to think about how to live with this further.

After analyzing my situation and the advice of my mentors, I decided to act as follows: I changed my attitude toward this unpleasant fact and decided that I would not use any contraceptives, and I informed my wife about this. As before, I did not particularly ask her opinion on this matter. I also decided: let as many children be born as God sends. I will accept them as God’s mercy and will not hinder their appearance in any way.

Since then nine years have passed. We have had three children, and during all this time we have never used contraceptives. At the same time, our sexual life has not stopped. We leave it to God Himself to decide when to send us children and how many.

You may ask: what about planning good offspring? If children are conceived like cats and dogs, will not cat-and-dog children be born? Would it not be better to use contraception and at the right moment conceive a good child, following the laws of favorable conception?

It is up to you, readers, to decide how to act. I have chosen this strategy and do not regret it at all. What the results will be, time will show. For now, reality is more joyful than sad. I have wonderful children whom I personally received from my wife’s womb. They bring inexpressible happiness in association! They sing, dance, and rejoice together with us.

### **THE THIRD NAIL**

#### **NEVER FORCE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS TO LOVE GOD AND SERVE HIM.

JUST BE AN EXAMPLE FOR THEM.**

As I already said, the goal of my practice of bhakti-yoga is to restore my relationship with God, the Supreme Absolute Truth, one of whose names is Krishna. Relationships with any living being are built first of all on love and selfless service, and in relation to God this is absolutely fundamental. As a sincere follower of this path, I want my family to succeed in this as well.

My wife chose the path of bhakti-yoga at the same time I did. Unfortunately, unable to withstand the blows of fate, she weakened in her spiritual practice, and I was faced with a big problem: I began to carry her spiritual life together with my own. I tried with all my strength to push her to become more serious in her practice, but she did not want to. I pressured her, scolded her, begged her, criticized her. Nothing worked.

Then, just as in the case with sex, I came to terms with it and adopted a simple strategy: not to force her to practice, but to become more serious myself.

I began to hold morning spiritual programs at home, read the scriptures, prepare sanctified food and feed my family members and guests. This kind of practice in bhakti-yoga is called *sadhana-bhakti*. If a person devotes at least a small part of the early morning to spiritual practice, his day will go well, because the highest goal of life will remain before his eyes all day. And if he ends the day with an evening spiritual program, then the highest goal will even come into his dreams.

So I stopped pressuring my wife and in this way preserved stable relationships, which we have maintained for nine years already. Of course, this is not a very long time—but it is not a very short one either. I know for sure that if I had continued to pressure her, our family life would have ended quickly, and the goal would not have been achieved.

Now about the children. With the children things worked out better for me than with my wife. From the very beginning there was a firm conviction that you definitely cannot force them to love God. My wife had promised her spiritual teacher that she would practice bhakti-yoga all her life, so I reproached her for not keeping that promise. But as for the children, I decided firmly that I would not force them to follow my path. Let them choose for themselves what to do and what to strive for when they grow up.

So I decided not to tell them anything about spiritual practice until they themselves asked, and not to force them to do anything in this regard. I would simply practice bhakti-yoga myself every day and set an example for them.

It is too early to speak about final results. In general, one can judge a person only when he is being seen off on his last journey. Until then, everything is still not completely clear. But some events make me happy and strengthen my confidence that I am on the right path. Here are a few stories from the life of my children.


#### **THE ELDEST SON**

By six months he confidently recognized where God Krishna was in pictures and photographs.

By two and a half years he knew all the main mantras used in morning and evening bhakti-yoga programs.

Once, when he was five years old, we were walking home along a dark street. At home we have small Deities whom we worship according to the rules of bhakti-yoga. I told my son that we should hurry, because it was dark, there was no light at home, and the Deities would be scared there. My son looked at me and asked:

“Dad, the Deities are God, right?”

“Yes,” I said.

“God is the strongest. He’s not afraid of anyone,” my son continued.

“Well, yes,” I answered.

“Then that means the Deities won’t be scared in the dark room,” he concluded.

I had nothing to answer. The logic was flawless. The only thought that came to my mind was: where did such clear thinking come from at such a young age?

Once, when my son was six, he took a set of beads and chanted the Hare Krishna mantra 1,728 times in one day. I do this every day as my main practice of bhakti-yoga. I never asked him to do it. He just took and did it himself. For a child of his age, to do something like this is a real feat, because it is a long, monotonous practice. One can only guess who inspired him to do this. This happened several more times, and I never forced him.

I regularly organize street presentations of bhakti-yoga. This is called *sankirtana*. Once I started getting sick because I had to do sankirtana in winter. I told my wife that I was falling ill. My son heard this and said:

“Let me get sick instead of Dad, so he can keep doing sankirtana without interruption.”

The next story was told to me by my wife. Once I went out on sankirtana, and my wife stayed home with the children. She was in a bad mood and was scolding me in their presence. My son listened and listened, and then said:

“Mom, why are you scolding Dad? He’s a really good devotee.”

A devotee means a servant of God, a bhakti-yogi.

Once my son and I went to visit a beginner devotee. He had just set up an altar in his home and placed small Deities of Jagannatha, Baladeva, and Subhadra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I looked at how he had arranged everything, gave a few recommendations, and calmed down. But my son looked at the Deities and said:

“Dad, Jagannatha and Baladeva are wearing each other’s clothes.”

I looked—and it was true. Jagannatha is usually dressed in yellow, and Baladeva in blue. Here it was the other way around. I, an adult with many years of spiritual practice, did not notice this. A small child noticed immediately. And who taught him this?

Many such stories could be told. And notice: I never tell him about these things, never teach him, never force him.

#### **THE YOUNGER SON**

He is a little over a year old. Once he was standing and slamming a cabinet door. The noise was terrible. I shook my fist at him, and he showed his fist back at me. Then I folded my hands in a prayer gesture and said to him:

“Please, don’t slam the door.”

He stopped, came up to me, offered a full obeisance, embraced my feet, and pressed his head to them.

Sometimes he takes a sacred book and touches it to his forehead. I don’t know who taught him this, but these actions completely correspond to our spiritual tradition.

He already clearly says “Krishna” and “Prabhupada,” although he is not even a year and a half old. When I start reading the scriptures, he sits next to me, takes his children’s book, and starts “reading” too. I ring a bell—and he does the same. The number of such stories grows every day.

#### **THE DAUGHTER**

She is a little older than the younger son. She constantly surprises us with her “eastern” habits. Sometimes she dresses like a little nun, sometimes she covers her head with a scarf. She happily dances when we sing Hare Krishna, runs in front of everyone during street sankirtana, and sometimes hides in some dark corner and prays to God.

I look at my children, and hope grows in my heart that they will choose the right direction in life. And the main thing I do **not** do is this: I do not force them to love God. I can force them to brush their teeth, wash the dishes, clean up their toys. A child must know his duties from childhood. But to love God is a choice of the heart, not an obligation.


### **THE FOURTH NAIL**

#### **NEVER START WORK BEFORE TEN IN THE MORNING**

People usually do not think about the meaning of life at all. And even if they do, not every day. They get up right before work and immediately run there, completely forgetting to think about the purpose of life.

If a person has set out on this difficult path—the search for meaning—and if he already knows what the goal and meaning of life are, then it is very important for him to remind himself of this goal every morning, so as not to lose sight of it during the day. This is the most important action in human life. If you did not manage to do this, or forgot, or had no intention of doing it, that is the greatest loss in life. And no professional achievements or big earnings can make up for it.

Do not allow anything or anyone to interfere with this. And the early morning hours are the best time for spiritual practice and reflection on life’s values.

A common mistake of beginning householders is the desire to arrange their material life as quickly as possible. So, having set this goal, they begin to work hard to achieve it and completely forget that this is not the main thing, that this will come by itself if eternal values are in their proper place.

I also jumped into family life headfirst. I began making plans to earn money and for some time forgot about the higher goal. Fortunately, this did not last long—about eight months. I remembered my previous practice and the advice of my mentors and began gradually increasing the time devoted to morning spiritual practice. I began gradually reading spiritual books again, chanting the promised number of Hare Krishna mantras in the morning, and making sure that my earning activities did not take up the morning hours.

Eight years have passed since then, and I continue my morning spiritual practice almost without interruption. I feel real progress: my mind is fairly calm, and the goal of life is firmly fixed in my head and in my heart.


### **THE FIFTH NAIL**

#### **FAMILY MEMBERS ARE HIGHWAY ROBBERS**

This expression is taken from the ancient Vedic scripture *Srimad-Bhagavatam*:

> “O King, in this material world family members, though called wife and children, are exactly like tigers and jackals. As a shepherd carefully guards his sheep yet still loses them to tigers and jackals, and as a miser carefully guards his money yet still loses it to his household, so one inevitably loses everything to one’s family.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam, Canto 6)

I would very much like this not to be true, but it is the pure truth. And I receive confirmation of this every day. Desires connected with spending substantial sums of money are constantly being produced in my wife’s head. The children are still small, but I understand perfectly well that after some time their endless desires will join this stream and turn it into a raging river.

Fortunately, my mentors taught me a good lesson. They taught me how to react to such things. First, it is important to plan expenses—not just for a day ahead, but for a month, a quarter, a year, and for life—and to teach the household members to do the same. If family members express some desire that does not fit into the plans, an experienced householder usually says: “As soon as we have free money, we’ll buy it right away.” In this way, family members calm down for a while, and the householder gets a breather.

I noticed that as soon as you fulfill one insistent desire of your wife or children, another appears immediately, no less insistent. There is no difference between them, and the perspective is always the same: you need to pay out another sum. And if a man, driven by attachment to his family, immediately fulfills this desire, it does not become easier for him; he immediately finds himself needing to increase his efforts to make money.

If you do not fulfill their desire immediately, but postpone it, the emotional pressure is the same, but the need to increase your income does not arise. For example, your wife wants a new refrigerator, although the old one works fine. If you immediately agree, you will have to find the money, buy it, she will be happy for exactly five minutes, and on the sixth minute she will present you with a new request for an even larger amount—and start insisting on it.

So you strain yourself under pressure, get the money, give it away—and the pressure does not go away, it becomes even stronger. Therefore, wise people advise not to endlessly fulfill the desires of household members, but to do it in a planned way, guided by the higher goal, not by attachment to family members.


### **THE SIXTH NAIL**

#### **DO NOT GET DIVORCED**

Family life is already considered successful if the spouses manage to live together their whole lives and not get divorced.

The truth of life is that the initiators of divorce are usually wives, not husbands. And the reason is very simple. It is difficult for women to tolerate the burdens of material life, and in particular family life. Phrases like “We can’t live together anymore, let’s get divorced, I’m sick of everything, I’m filing for divorce” regularly come from women for exactly this reason, especially at the beginning of family life.

There is rarely malicious intent behind these words. If a woman herself brings the matter to a divorce process, it usually means someone has encouraged her. Most often divorce becomes a fact when the husband gets tired of enduring these statements and, giving up and giving in to emotions, says: “Fine, let’s get divorced, have it your way.”

Therefore, do not pay too much attention to such statements. Simply endure them, be attentive to your wife, and calm her mind. Over the years, passions subside, attachments weaken, and such statements arise less and less often.

But you still will not avoid divorce if you lose sight of the higher goal. If you always remember that the purpose of family life is to become disillusioned with material existence and reach the spiritual world, you will treat the opportunity given to you by fate responsibly and will not jump from one wife to another. Every new attempt will bring the same troubles and the same disappointments.


### **THE SEVENTH NAIL**

#### **FAMILY LIFE IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME PATIENT AND HUMBLE**

At first there is the illusion that this time everything will work out. We will live happily, die on the same day, and reach the highest goal of life together. Reality turns out to be shockingly different.

Women today are very emancipated—that is, independent and self-sufficient. That is how they are educated now. Therefore, from the very beginning your wife will shout at you and show signs of extreme disrespect—despite the fact that you will be giving everything you have and working like a donkey at three jobs.

This is not the wife’s fault; it is the result of the modern system of education. The nature of a woman is to be under protection and depend on a man. If a woman shows signs of this dependence and behaves accordingly, a man naturally wants to take care of her. But modern women behave in such a way that it sometimes makes you want to run away from them as fast as possible.

All this is very disillusioning. For example, I was disappointed in family life one week after the wedding. And if I had had at that time the wise book from which I quoted above, I probably would not have married at all. Disappointed, I ran to my mentor and told him this. He answered that this was only superficial disappointment and that I needed to go to the end.

And so I have been enduring everything that is happening for nine years now, and I understand that all this is God’s plan, and that He will help me.

In general, emancipation is a disease of modern civilization. How many wonderful things we could accomplish, what amazing results we could achieve, if not for this sickness. The very concept of emancipation contradicts the ideals of a truly developed civilization. And it is unlikely that the problems caused by emancipation can be solved by “civilized” methods.

At the beginning of family life I was very attached to my wife, and the very thought of losing her was unbearable for me. Therefore I endured all her behavior and was afraid to touch her—what if she left? And now, after many years of life together, I am completely convinced of one thing: if not for this foolish, dog-like attachment, I would not have allowed her to behave this way.

A few times I reacted very harshly when her behavior became completely unbearable. After these incidents she usually behaved better. And now, looking back, I understand that it should have been dealt with much earlier. But attachment deprived me of that possibility at the beginning of household life.


### **THE EIGHTH NAIL**

#### **EMANCIPATION MAKES A WOMAN VERY UNHAPPY**

God made a woman dependent on a man in all respects. From this follows the following law of happiness for a woman:

**A WOMAN’S HAPPINESS IS IN BEING CONTENT WITH THE POSITION SHE IS IN.**

To always be content means to deeply realize one’s dependent position on a man, to see in him support and protection.

Modern women will surely disagree with me. They want to be independent and self-sufficient. Usually neither one nor the other works out, because it contradicts female nature.

There are many jokes about female unpredictability. “A woman driving is already an emergency situation.” The reason is the same: the difficulty of making decisions, both in big things and in small ones. Every day, in all situations, all her life, a woman needs male protection and care. And emancipation takes away from a woman even the possibility of being protected, because the basis of emancipation philosophy is equality of the sexes and, as a result, enormous pride: *I am a woman, a living being equal to a man.*

Because of this pride, women constantly get into foolish, and sometimes dangerous, situations that bring them great suffering and make them dissatisfied and unhappy.

To illustrate this, I will tell you one story.

Once I observed my wife and her friend. We were at a cheerful celebration, but the children began to cry, and they decided to go home—especially since there was a car they could ride with. They stood in one place for about half an hour, and it was obvious that they were suffering and could not decide whether to go or not. They wanted to stay and dance, but the children were crying and not letting them enjoy themselves. They asked me for advice several times. Ignoring my advice, they continued to suffer and were already beginning to lose their minds—and at the same time seriously testing the patience of the driver.

I had seen such scenes many times before and finally exclaimed in my heart: “Lord, what kind of women are there nowadays! They don’t listen to anyone, and they can’t decide anything themselves!”

The women lowered their heads and smiled. After that outburst, the situation somehow resolved itself. My wife stayed, and her friend went home.

You may ask: what should one do then? What can one do, gentlemen? Endure and continue living together. The main thing is not to follow Chernyshevsky, who in his famous book answered the question *What Is to Be Done?* with: *Make a revolution.*

Do not make any revolutions in family life—that is, **do not get divorced**. Continue to fulfill your duties and do not lose sight of the higher goal of life.


### **THE NINTH NAIL**

#### **A WOMAN IS A TRAP OF MATERIAL ENERGY (MAYA) FOR A MAN**

It is usually said that a man is also a trap for a woman. But to put it that way would not be entirely accurate. On the material level, there is a difference between a man and a woman; they are, in fact, different forms of life.

If we consider this philosophically and logically, a man is usually oriented toward striving for the highest goal, and for a woman this is somewhat more difficult. Therefore, the usual sequence is: the husband strives for perfection and serves God, the woman follows the husband, and the children follow her.

In ordinary worldly family life, it is usually the other way around. The one with the most restless mind goes first—that is, the children. They openly express their excessive desires. The wife, not wanting to refuse them, pressures the husband, adding her own desires, and the husband, driven by attachment to both, is simply busy fulfilling their desires, adding his own as well. And so everyone rolls into hell.

Material nature (maya) arranges things so that this happens constantly. If a man immediately chooses this second line of behavior, he simply becomes unable to see the higher goal.

If, however, he acts according to the first line, then material nature constantly tests him, creates situations in which he must make a precise decision and act correctly, guided by the higher goal. And usually maya deceives him. Thus, the householder who has true knowledge of life gradually gains experience in how to uncover this deception and resist it. Over time he becomes very strong, his intelligence becomes firm, and his mind increasingly comes under control.

And the main thing: the illusion that one can be happy in family life dissipates, and disillusionment with material existence grows more and more. A firm conviction appears in the heart:

**I WILL NEVER MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN. I WILL NEVER AGAIN GET INVOLVED IN FAMILY LIFE.**


### **THE TENTH NAIL**

#### **FAMILY LIFE IS A RELIABLE SHELTER

AND THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST GOAL OF LIFE**

You may be surprised by such a turn. For several pages I criticized family life, and now suddenly I declare it a reliable shelter. And yet, this is so.

Only a few people in this world can live a truly renounced life, which is considered the most suitable for achieving perfection. Most people are not capable of this in the modern age. Therefore God has arranged things in such a way that in this very way of life most modern people have the opportunity to achieve the highest perfection.

When I was studying in a monastery, looking at the renounced monks, I myself wanted to become a monk. And after entering family life, I did not abandon this desire. For many years I wanted it, especially when disappointment became unbearable.

But one day a miracle happened. I came across a very unusual philosophical book, *Sri Caitanya-caritamrita*. Its translator and commentator, Srila Prabhupada, writes the following in one of his commentaries:

> “Although Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself accepted sannyasa at a young age, His followers are not required to follow His example. One may remain a householder and worship Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In this way one will be happy, because all material opulences will come—good house, good children, good wife, ample money, and everything else one may desire. Therefore the shastras advise: *yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ*.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.5.32)

> “All householders who are actually intelligent should carry the saṅkīrtana movement from door to door in this life and live happily, and in the next life return home, back to Godhead.”
> (Caitanya-caritamrita, Adi-lila 14.55, purport)

When I read this statement of Srila Prabhupada, my mind immediately became calm. The desire to become a monk disappeared. I saw family life from a completely different angle. I suddenly understood that my wife is my closest friend, who helps me practice spiritual life. I saw that my children will surely grow up to be good people, and that everything in our life will work out.

Our life is getting better every day: we earn more, our living conditions improve, desires are gradually fulfilled, we become more pious, life becomes more orderly. I am happy, and I see that my wife and children are also happy. We have wonderful prospects.

And all this is for one simple reason: I managed to dedicate my life to the Sankirtana Movement. I do not have great intelligence and understand that all this happened by the mercy of God and His close servants.

Many years of life are still ahead. What other obstacles will arise on my path? I do not know. But I am firmly convinced of the correctness of the path I have chosen.

And I ask you, my readers:

**PLEASE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR LIFE IN VAIN.
DEDICATE IT TO SPREADING THE SANKIRTANA MOVEMENT OF
SRI CAITANYA MAHAPRABHU,
AND YOUR FAMILY LIFE WILL BE TRULY SUCCESSFUL.**


### (Letter)


So what, then, is the union of a man and a woman?

I still remember the answer of Chaitanya Chandra Prabhu to my question:
“How can we (micro-rakshasas) follow the path of the great sages and saintly devotees, when we not only have no baggage of spiritual culture at all, but even have a negative one — the experience of developed ignorance?”

The answer was this:
“Culture is the level of relationships between men and women.”

And Chaitanya Chandra Charan Prabhu also remarked that now, for us men, there can be no progress in chanting the Holy Name without a proper attitude toward women — no Krishna-prema. In the consciousness of men, an image of a saintly woman must appear.

This answer struck me deeply and made me think. Every man must define for himself what a proper attitude toward women means for him.

How did everything connected with marriage begin for me? With my parents’ family, of course. My father took his marriage very seriously and did not accept relationships with women outside of marriage. This samskara (impression) settled deeply in my heart. As for my mother, for her marriage was sheer punishment. She was more attracted to social relationships, without any obligations. This also sank into my heart.

Now I cannot imagine my life without marriage, and at the same time thousands of desires torment my heart — to imitate Krishna in His rasa dance, or to have, like Him, sixteen thousand wives. Such a chimera lives in my heart.

We have been living together for six years. These were not easy six years. We lived together in the temple. We went out together to distribute books. And together we fell into the deepest tama-guna. Everything was together.

Many times it drove us to despair that we had no home. No money. We changed a thousand jobs. These problems are like those of many families of our age. In Kali-yuga not a single married couple has the blessing to live together (Srimad-Bhagavatam, Canto 1). Husband and wife spend all their time outside the home, far from the family, earning money just to survive.

A thousand times I wanted to take a big nuclear bomb and send the whole world to hell. But by Krishna’s mercy, somehow it worked out without a bomb.

My wife closes her eyes to my constant shortcomings. I close my eyes to the temporary outbursts of shortcomings in her. And so we sail together, on the same ship of our family, toward Krishna.

Krishna gave us teachers — disciples of Srila Prabhupada — so that we would not lose our course. He gave us Prabhupada’s books — our sea charts. He gave us the association of wonderful Vaishnava devotees. He gave ISKCON — this state, or rather this fleet, in which our family lives among the ships of other devotees’ families.

Sometimes we fall and have no strength to go on. Sometimes you want to kill everyone. Sometimes our marriage seems to us just a union for having sex. But still, after lying down and recovering, we get back on our feet again and go toward our goal, and think: let everyone live.

The Deities help us. We simply “captured” Them, like pirates capture hostages. We worship Them in what used to be our house and is now Their house. Constant thoughts about the Deities help us very much not to lose heart. They are our captives and our children, however sahajiya (sentimental) this may sound.

By cleansing our dirty minds, our Deities enter into them.

We do not have the qualities of true disciples, and our nearest goal is to acquire these qualities. We greatly value our tiny service to Krishna and the devotees, and we are ready to “tear apart” anyone who tries to destroy it.

Following the instruction of Bhaktivinoda Thakura, a devotee must protect his bhakti-lata, his creeper of devotion. So we will fight to the death even with Krishna Himself for the opportunity to serve Him, our beloved — not to mention all the other inhabitants of all the worlds.

Marriage in our spiritual society is the rarest chance to find a friend in Krishna consciousness. And our family found this chance in the person of husband and wife. And these years we have spent together gave us exactly such friendship as Bhaktivinoda Thakura spoke about.

I do not know what awaits us further. But the years we have lived together have given us many warm memories connected with the Lord and the devotees.

A woman embodies dharma for a man. I feel that I am protected by God if I take care of my child and my wife. The mercy of the grihastha-ashrama is to give souls a favorable birth in a family of God’s devotees and to receive Vaishnava upbringing.

Our marriage is a mutually beneficial cooperation of a man who can see far, but does not notice what is right under his nose, and a woman who sees well what is near, but cannot look far. It is a union of my reason and my wife’s feelings, a union of attachment and renunciation. Such is our personal grihastha-ashrama.

Each ashrama is one leg of the bull of dharma. The grihastha-ashrama promotes self-realization. When a man and a woman meet, a deep self-analysis takes place. A man, choosing a woman, gives himself an evaluation. And that evaluation is the woman.

This is self-realization and understanding of our own nature for me and my wife. Over time, we discovered that we think and feel the same. An amazing feeling of synchrony of thoughts and feelings. We have become one whole. For us, this is a qualitatively new, amazing life.

What can one wish young grihastha devotees? Tolerance! Tolerance! Tolerance! In everything, have patience!

Krishna consciousness adds taste to our life. It opens a world of colors of love and elevated relationships, based on self-sacrifice and self-giving.

We beg the devotees for compassion toward our family.
We ask for their mercy and their forgiveness.
We ask for their blessings.


### (Letter)

Dear devotees, please accept our humble obeisances!

In truth, our ashram is difficult to call a grihastha-ashrama — it is more like a brahmachari-ashrama. To some it may seem strange, because even in our society people are sometimes criticized if they do not fit into generally accepted standards. But this has not frightened me for a long time, because I have a goal, and I have a friend — my husband — who always helps me.

Why do I say “I have” and not “we have”? Because our goals are somewhat different. But this does not prevent us from helping and respecting one another.

We met before Krishna consciousness, and not by accident at all. We traced the events of our lives and came to an unshakable conclusion that Krishna was leading us in such a way that one beautiful day we would meet. Of course, at first there was some kind of infatuation, but even then these relationships were more like friendship than romance. We tried to make each other better. He always asked me to drink less, I asked him not to smoke. In this, care and concern were already showing — things that are so lacking everywhere nowadays. Now people do not care if their friend or girlfriend is drinking himself into ruin or smoking, destroying health and consciousness. Even then, we tried to protect each other.

There were frequent quarrels because neither of us wanted to give in; each put his false ego first. Several times we tried to break off the relationship, but each time the Lord spoke from deep within my heart: “You need him. He is your friend, who helped you and can help you in the future.” And listening to this voice, I tried to restore the relationship.

Later I became acquainted with Krishna consciousness, and here I was given lectures on the grihastha-ashrama by Audarya Dhama Prabhu. I did not really like these lectures, because they said that a woman should be a meek little sheep, which did not at all fit my fiery nature. Still, I tried, forcing myself, to do something of what he advised, just to see how it works. It was very difficult.

Soon prabhu noticed changes in my behavior and habits. He asked about it, and I told him that I had decided to radically change my life and never return to my former dirt. I admitted that I had found the association I had been looking for for a long time.

Everything was very complicated during that period. There were acceptance and rejection, struggle, falls, leaving and returning. It was very hard. Once, because of my own pride, I was left completely alone, and the question arose: I had to choose between prabhu and Krishna. I never tell anyone about my problems except my husband, but then I constantly cried and prayed to Krishna very, very sincerely, like to my closest friend. I asked Him to give me intelligence.

And later, when it was necessary to make a decision, I said that I choose Krishna, because He is my only friend who really supported me through all that difficult time and kept me from doing something foolish.

After that, prabhu changed very much. He again began to associate with devotees, returned to the society, began to chant his rounds and follow all the principles. We decided to live together without registering our marriage, because there were no marital relations, but we became very close and good friends.

What is this friendship? We help each other go toward Krishna, not sink into maya, and, most importantly, not become proud of our insignificant achievements in Krishna consciousness. Of course, small misunderstandings happen, because we are in different bodies, which find it hard to understand each other. But we try to avoid them, apologize more often, and try more to serve each other.

Now serving my husband is not a burden for me, but a pleasant way to spend time.

How did it happen that friends became spouses? Before initiation, my Srila Gurudeva asked me whether we had registered our relationship. I said no, and that we did not want to. He said that this was very bad. Because in Krishna’s eyes I was a prostitute, and therefore, for me and for our further progress, it would be better if I were under protection. He also frightened me by saying that he would not give initiation until I showed a stamp in my passport. Thus we became lawful spouses.

It is amazing, but our relationship and respect for each other are improving and growing stronger. Quite recently we admitted to each other that if not for Krishna consciousness, we would have separated long ago because of our hypertrophied false ego. But only thanks to Krishna consciousness have we learned to value and respect each other.

We also noted one important and precious thing — that we are ready to forgive each other the most terrible qualities that still remain in us, only because both of us are in this Movement, chant japa, engage in service, follow the instructions of our gurus and love them. *Api cet sudurācāro…*

Therefore, I want to say to young devotees who have chosen the grihastha-ashrama: no matter how hard it is for you, remember that next to you is a saintly person who, just like you, loves Krishna and is going toward Him. And he or she very much needs your support and help in this world of terrible relationships of deception, betrayal, and lies.

Always remember that Krishna is near. He is your close and only friend, who has sent you His servant so that you may help him, and he may help you return home, back to Krishna, to participate in His endless, nectar-filled lilas.
